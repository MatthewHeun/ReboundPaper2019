%% Abstract %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{abstract}
% A concise and factual abstract is required.
% The abstract should state briefly 
% the purpose of the research, 
% the principal results, and
% major conclusions. 
% An abstract is often presented separately from the article, 
% so it must be able to stand alone.
% For this reason, References should be avoided, but if essential, 
% then cite the author(s) and year(s).
% Also, non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but
% if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself.
Widespread implementation of energy efficiency measures
is an important global strategy to meet Paris greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. 
However, energy rebound can ``take back'' efficiency-based
energy reductions via behavior changes and economic effects.
If rebound effects are larger than typically assumed, 
efficiency-based efforts to reduce carbon emissions 
will be less effective than supposed.
% The problem
An operationalized rebound analysis framework is needed
to study non-marginal energy efficiency changes
for specific energy efficiency upgrades, 
one that discriminates among all rebound effects
in energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces
with a detailed model of consumer responses 
for non-marginal energy efficiency changes.
% Our response
In response, 
we develop a comprehensive rebound analysis framework that 
employs a constant elasticity of substitution utility model to 
describe direct and indirect locations
for emplacement, substitution, and income rebound effects. 
We utilize a macro factor to link
macroeconomic to microeconomic rebound effects.
A sequence of novel graphs shows rebound paths through 
energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces.
The framework is applied to two case studies: 
upgrades of a car and an electric lamp.
% Results
After calibrating the macro factor,
we find total rebound of 48\% and 80\% 
for the car and lamp examples, respectively.
Sensitivity studies are performed, showing the effects of 
energy efficiency, capital cost, energy price, 
energy service price elasticity of energy demand, and 
the macro factor on rebound components.
Policy implications are discussed.

Energy rebound is a phenomenon whereby 
some expected energy savings fail to materialize 
after an energy efficiency upgrade (EEU)
due to behavior changes and economic effects.
Famously, the roots of energy rebound trace back to 
\citeauthor{Jevons:1865}
who, in \emph{The Coal Question}, said 
``[\emph{i}]\emph{t is wholly a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical 
use of fuel is equivalent to a diminished consumption. 
The very contrary is the truth}'' \citep[p.~103, emphasis in original]{Jevons:1865}.
Less famously, the origins of rebound may extend further backward 
from \citeauthor{Jevons:1865}
to \citet{Williams1840}
who quoted \citeauthor{Parkes1838}:
``[t]he economy of fuel is the secret of the economy of the steam-engine; 
it is the fountain of its power, and the adopted measure of its effects. 
Whatever, therefore, conduces to increase the efficiency of coal, 
and to diminish the cost of its use, 
directly tends to augment the value of the steam-engine, 
and to enlarge the field of its operations''~\citep[p.~161]{Parkes1838}.
For nearly 200 years, then, it has been understood 
that efficiency gains may be taken back or, paradoxically even, 
drive growth in energy consumption.

The oil crises of the 1970s shone a light back onto energy efficiency,
and a modern debate over the magnitude of energy rebound commenced. 
On one side, scholars including \citet{Brookes1979, Brookes1990} and \citet{Khazzoom1980} 
suggested rebound could be large.
Others, including \citet{Lovins1988} and \citet{Grubb1990, Grubb1992},
claimed rebound was likely to be small.

Debate over the size of energy rebound continues today.
Advocates of small rebound (less than, say, 50\%),
suggest ``the rebound effect is overplayed''~\citep[p.~475]{Gillingham:2013aa},
while others, 
including \citet{Saunders2015} and \citet{Stern2020},
claim the evidence for large rebound
(greater than 50\%)
is growing.
(Rebound above 100\% is known as ``backfire'' \citep{Saunders:2000aa}.)
\citet{sonnberger2018rebound} suggest that the acceleration of everyday life 
is evidence of rebound.

Amidst the rebound debate,
energy efficiency measures are expected to deliver
energy-related 
CO$_2$ emissions reductions in support of
Paris Agreement targets~\citep{masson-delmotte2018},
even while the world economy grows.
In one 
example, by 2050
energy efficiency is expected to
contribute 37\% of 
energy-related carbon emissions reductions globally
in the International Energy Agency's (IEA's) Sustainable Development 
scenario~\citep[Fig.~2.1]{InternationalEnergyAgency2019}%
\footnote{
  Note that emissions reductions in the Sustainable Development scenario
  are relative to the IEA's Stated Policies scenario, 
  which itself includes planned energy efficiency.
}.
%
However, a study (by the present authors and two others) shows 
that the expected reductions in energy consumption 
would represent a significant structural break from the historical record
of tight coupling between energy consumption and GDP \citep[Figs.~1 and~2]{Brockway2021}.
The same study also found that 
``many of the mechanisms driving rebound effects are overlooked by 
integrated assessment and global energy models'' \citep[p.~1]{Brockway2021}.
Thus, energy rebound is much more than an academic debate, 
because there is a lot at stake. 
Large rebound, if it exists and if it is not fully 
included in models from which policies are derived, would mean that
efficiency-based efforts to reduce carbon emissions may be less effective than supposed, 
and achieving Paris emissions reduction targets will be at risk.
So understanding the magnitude of energy rebound resulting from an EEU is important,
and developing clear and comprehensive ways
to estimate rebound is essential.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Rebound analysis frameworks}
\label{sec:rebound_frameworks}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Rebound analysis frameworks are used to estimate the magnitude of rebound effects 
and total rebound from an EEU.
We use the word ``framework'' to mean 
the basic structure for analysis of a system or concept,
in this case energy rebound.
We define a rebound framework to be a rebound typology
applied to the task of estimating rebound for a particular EEU.
A rebound typology is a description and explication of rebound effects, locations, and scales.
Rebound frameworks are operationalized by a series of equations,
typically ending with a summation equation for
total rebound across all effects, locations, and scales.
For accurate analysis of the size of rebound from a given EEU, 
rebound frameworks should be comprehensive, 
accounting for all rebound effects
in energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces
with a detailed model of consumer responses 
to non-marginal energy efficiency changes.

In the subsections that follow, 
rebound frameworks are further elucidated, 
starting with features of rebound typologies and analysis spaces.
Thereafter, characteristics of rebound frameworks are discussed, 
including 
the importance of detailed models of consumer preferences, 
the importance of non-marginal energy service price changes, and 
the need for operationality.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Typologies: effects, locations, scales} 
\label{sec:rebound_typologies}
%------------------------------

Anyt comprehensive rebound framework should include 
in its typology
emplacement, substitution, income, and macro effects.
For a given EEU, 
it cannot be known \emph{a priori}
which rebound effects will be large and which will be small, 
so all effects should be analyzed.
The emplacement effect of an EEU includes 
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]
	
  \item expected energy savings, assuming no behavioral changes;
  
  \item embodied energy effects, i.e., changes across the EEU of the embodied energy rate 
        of the energy conversion device; and 
        
  \item maintenance and disposal effects 
        (changes in the energy implications of 
        these activities caused by the EEU).
    
\end{enumerate*}
%
The substitution effect accounts for behavior changes across the EEU,
typically increased use of the upgraded device and decreased consumption of other goods,
assuming no change in device owner utility.
The emplacement and substitution effects create net monetary savings
which are spent by the device owner 
in the income effect on more of the energy service and 
more other goods and services. 
Finally, the macro effect accounts for long-run economic expansion 
(and subsequent rising energy consumption),
because the EEU is a cost-saving technological change.

Rebound occurs at direct and indirect locations.
Direct rebound involves takeback of expected savings of energy
consumed by the device.
Indirect rebound arises from increased energy consumption 
in other locations and in other economic sectors
as a result of the EEU.

Rebound scales include microeconomic and macroeconomic.
Microeconomic rebound arises from the series of adjustments
to the reduction in the implicit price of the energy service. 
A static economy is assumed. 
Microeconomic effects include the emplacement, substitution, and income effects.
Macroeconomic rebound arises from the 
dynamic response of the economy to reach a new stable equilibrium
(between supply and demand for goods and energy services)
in response to the EEU.
Macroeconomic rebound involves various short- and long-run effects.

% \begin{table}
%   \caption{Rebound typology (right column) with comparison to existing literature (center column).}
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure_other/typology.pdf}
%   \label{tab:typology}
% \end{table}

Because a lot is at stake when analyzing energy rebound, 
it is important that rebound analysis frameworks
account for all effects, locations, and scales.
Everything links together!
The emplacement effect
frees the device owner's cash to be spent in the income effect,
with energy implications.
The substitution effect describes behavior adjustments that 
provide net savings to be spent in the income effect, 
again with energy implications.
And the rate of net savings initiates the macro effect.
(We note briefly that 
the link between microeconomic and macroeconomic scales 
is largely unexplored territory.
See Section~\ref{sec:macro_effect_main_paper}
for our approach to the macro effect.)


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Rebound spaces} 
\label{sec:rebound_spaces}
%------------------------------

A comprehensive rebound framework will enable analyses
in several conceptual ``spaces'' in which changes occur
because of the EEU.
Similar to rebound effects,
energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces are all linked together.
To give just a few examples, 
net income from the EEU spent on more of the energy service 
(described in the expenditure space)
will have different energy implications
from net income spent on other goods and services
(described in the energy space).
The device owner's consumption preferences (expressed in the consumption space)
have repercussions in both the energy and expenditure spaces.
Embodied energy (in the energy space) may be larger
for more expensive upgrades (in the expenditure space).
Because everything is linked together, 
each rebound effect should be analyzed for its adjustments 
in energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Consumer preferences} 
\label{sec:consumer_preferences}
%------------------------------

A comprehensive rebound framework will include a detailed description of consumer preferences,
because device owner preferences drive the substitution effect.
By ``detailed,'' we mean **** GS to complete subsubsection as 1 or 2 paragraphs. ---MKH ****


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Non-marginal energy efficiency changes} 
\label{sec:non_marginal_changes}
%------------------------------

A comprehensive rebound framework will allow non-marginal efficiency changes,
because EEUs often involve a very large percentage increase in energy efficiency.
A good example of non-marginal energy efficiency changes is 
replacing incandescent lamps with Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamps.
For such EEUs, energy efficiency can increase by nearly a factor of 10!


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Operationality} 
\label{sec:operationalizable}
%------------------------------

An operational rebound analysis framework is one that includes
sufficient descriptions of energy rebound 
for all effects, locations, and scales
in all spaces (energy, expenditure, and consumption) to calculate
quantitative estimates of rebound effects with real-world data.
This is particularly important for microeconomically grounded
rebound frameworks that involve unobserved utility functions and,
by extension, substitution and income effects.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Previous frameworks} 
\label{sec:previous_frameworks}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

% **** 
% GS: Should we also discuss the different types of frameworks from the 
% previous version of the introduction? 
% I'm thinking about microeconomic, macroeconomic (rare), and 
% CGE, non-CGE? 
% This could be the place where we defend our approach
% compared to the CGE crowd. 
% ---MKH 
% ****

Bringing together the high stakes of energy efficiency 
\emph{vis-\`{a}-vis} emissions reduction goals
and the desirable characteristics of rebound frameworks discussed above,
we see that comprehensive rebound frameworks are needed for 
developing energy efficiency policy to meet emissions targets. 
Effective policy should be informed by rebound analyses conducted within
a comprehensive rebound framework with firm theoretical foundations.

In fact, several scholars have developed previous rebound analysis frameworks.
*** MKH, is this a good place to say two sentences about how we do
not look at total rebound frameworks? ---GS ***
It is worthwhile to evaluate those frameworks for
the key features discussed above: 
analysis at all effects, locations, and scales; 
analysis in energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces; 
a detailed model of consumer preferences;
non-marginal energy efficiency changes; and 
operationality.
For only when all of the above characteristics are present can  
a comprehensive picture of rebound emerge.

Table~\ref{tab:previous_frameworks} contains our assessment 
of selected relevant previous frameworks (in columns)
relative to the important characteristics discussed above (in rows).
Empty (white) circles indicate no treatment of a subject by a framework. 
Partially and fully filled circles indicate 
partial and comprehensive treatment of a subject by a framework.

\input{pieces/prev_frameworks_table.tex}

Because all frameworks look at decreasing energy consumption from the EEU,
the ``Direct emplacement effect'' row contains \rating{50} or better
for all previous frameworks.
Three early papers \citep{Nassen:2009aa, Thomas:2013aa, Thomas:2013ab}
estimate rebound quantitatively, 
earning high marks (\rating{100}) in the ``Operationality'' row. 
Both motivate their frameworks at least partially with microeconomic theory
(consumer preferences and substitution and income effects)
but use simple linear demand functions in their empirical analyses.  
Thus, the connection between economic theory and empirics is tenuous, 
leading to intermediate ratings (\rating{50}) in the
``substitution effects,''
``income effects,''
and
``Detailed model of consumer preferences'' rows.
More recently, \citet{Chan2015} and \citet{Wang2021}
anchor the rebound effect firmly in consumer theory, 
earning high ratings (\rating{100}) in the
``substitution effects,''
``income effects,'' and 
``Detailed model of consumer preferences'' rows. 
They extend their frameworks to advanced topics such as
multiple fuels,  
energy services, and
nested utility functions with intermediate inputs. 
However, neither framework exhibits operationality,
earning \rating{0} in the last row of Table~\ref{tab:previous_frameworks}. 
In the middle of the table (and between the other studies in time), 
the \citet{Borenstein:2015aa} framework 
touches on nearly all important characteristics.
However, the \citeauthor{Borenstein:2015aa} framework
cannot separate substitution and income effects cleanly in empirical analysis, 
reverting to partial analyses of both, 
leading to a \rating{50} rating in the ``Detailed model of consumer preferences'' row.

No study engages fully with both the differential financial and energetic effects
of the upfront purchase of the upgraded device, 
leading to low ratings across all previous frameworks in the
``Capital cost and embodied energy effect'' row.
In fact, except for \citep{Nassen:2009aa},
no framework engages with capital costs, 
although all note its importance. 
(\citeauthor{Nassen:2009aa} note that 
capital costs and embodied energy can have very strong effects on rebound.)
\citet{Thomas:2013aa,Thomas:2013ab} provide the only framework 
that traces embodied energy effects
of every consumer good using input-output methods, but
they do not analyze embodied energy of the upgraded device.
\citet{Borenstein:2015aa} notes
the embodied energy of the upgraded device
and the embodied energy of other goods
but does not integrate embodied energy
or financing costs into the framework for empirical analysis. 
\citeauthor{Borenstein:2015aa} is the only author to treat the financial side of 
embodied energy or maintenance and disposal effects. 
\citet{Borenstein:2015aa} postulates the macro effect, 
but does not develop the idea into an operational theory, 
earning \rating{25} in the ``Macro effect'' row. 
No other frameworks even discuss the link between macro and micro rebound effects, 
leading to \rating{0} in the ``Macro effect'' row for all other previous frameworks. 
Finally, all previous frameworks assume constant price elasticities and
implicitly ``marginal'' or small improvements in efficiency, 
excluding the analysis of important non-incremental upgrades. 
Therefore, all previous frameworks earn \rating{0} in the 
``Non-marginal energy service price changes'' row.

Table~\ref{tab:previous_frameworks} shows that 
previous frameworks contain many needed pieces, 
providing a substantial base from which to develop 
a comprehensive and operational rebound analysis framework.
A left-to-right reading of the table 
demonstrates that previous frameworks start from micoreconomic
consumer theory and move towards more rigorous theoretical treatment over time,
with recent frameworks making important advanced theoretical contributions
at the expense of operationality.
In the end, no previous rebound analysis framework 
combines all rebound effects, locations, and scales
across energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces with 
a detailed model of consumer preferences and
non-marginal energy service price changes
in an operational manner
for the simplest case
of a single fuel and a single energy service.
In particular, the macro effect and non-marginal price changes 
require conceptual development and operationalization.
This paper aims to fill the gaps in Table~\ref{tab:previous_frameworks},
completing the ``This paper'' column with filled circles (\rating{100}).

\subsection{Need, aim, contributions, and structure}
\label{sec:aim_contribution_structure}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There is a strategic \emph{need} for 
a comprehensive rebound analysis framework
to firm up theoretical foundations, 
enable empirical analysis, and 
guide effective energy efficiency policy-making.
In particular the framework should be one that 
combines all rebound effects, locations, and scales
across energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces
with 
a detailed model of consumer preferences and
non-marginal energy service price changes
in an operationalizable manner.
The \emph{aim} of this paper is therefore to build upon 
the strong foundations laid by 
previous authors (in Table~\ref{tab:previous_frameworks})
to develop a comprehensive energy rebound analysis framework.
The key \emph{contributions} of this paper are 
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]
	
  \item developing the first (to our knowledge)
        comprehensive rebound analysis framework
        that accommodates non-marginal energy service price decreases
        and non-marginal energy efficiency increases,

  \item providing the first (to our knowledge) visualizations of rebound effects
        in energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces, and 
        
  \item creating the first (to our knowledge) operationalized link between 
        rebound effects on macroeconomic and microeconomic scales. 
  
\end{enumerate*}

The remainder of this paper is \emph{structured} as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:framework} describes the comprehensive rebound analysis framework.
Section~\ref{sec:examples} provides two examples: 
energy efficiency upgrades to a car and an electric lamp.
Section~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses the results, and 
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.


% Commented text below is from the previous introduction.
% We can consider it to be an organ donor for the new introduction, 
% when needed.
% Or, some pieces of the commented text below can find their ways to 
% other sections of the paper.

% Those who study energy rebound usually identify 
% locations and levels of rebound.
% Rebound \emph{locations} typically include
% direct rebound effects 
% (associated with energy to run the energy conversion device) and
% indirect rebound effects
% (energy effects of other expenditures in the broader economy).
% Rebound \emph{levels} typically align with economic levels, namely
% micro
% (rebound at the single device level within a static economy)
% and
% macro
% (rebound caused by dynamic responses of the broader economy).
% 
% \citet{Sorrell:2007um} led
% an important systematic review of energy rebound estimates,
% considering over 500 studies and reports from around the world.
% He found that most studies focused on direct, microeconomic rebound in the household,
% with studies typically estimating small rebound magnitudes (10--30\%).
% In contrast, 
% he found
% weaker evidence for macroeconomic rebound, 
% but far larger magnitudes, 
% stating 
% ``[t]his evidence base is both small and subject to a number of important methodological weaknesses, 
% making it difficult to draw any general conclusions. 
% However, the available studies suggest that economy-wide [macroeconomic] 
% rebound effects may frequently exceed 50\%'' \citep[p.~9]{Sorrell:2007um}.
% 
% Since the~\citet{Sorrell:2007um} review,
% empirical estimates of (typically) household energy rebound
% at the microeconomic level (both direct and indirect locations)
% continue to suggest relatively small
% microeconomic rebound magnitudes
% of less than 40\%. 
% (See \citet{Greene2012}, \citet{Thomas:2013ab}, \citet{Antal:2014aa}, 
% \citet{Chitnis2014}, and \citet{Stapleton:2016}.)
% Commonly, microeconomic rebound estimates are based on own-sector (direct)
% and/or
% cross-sector (indirect, re-spending) price elasticities,
% as set out by \citet{Gillingham2016}. 
% \citet{dahlqvist2021rebound} provides an example of this price elasticity 
% approach applied to energy-intensive industry sectors.
% 
% While estimates of microeconomic rebound are common, 
% estimates of macroeconomic rebound remain very rare.
% (See \citet{Barker2009} for an exception that proves the rule.) 
% However, a growing number of studies are estimating 
% the magnitude of total rebound 
% (the sum of microeconomic and macroeconomic rebound),
% and finding large rebound values.
% Indeed, a recent review of 33 such studies found an 
% average total rebound magnitude of over 60\%, 
% which was suggested as being 
% ``larger than commonly assumed''~\citep[p.~1]{Brockway2021}.
% First, was a group of 21 Computational General Equilibrium (CGE) studies, 
% including \citet{Lecca2014}, \citet{Broberg2015}, and \citet{Wei2017},
% with a mean total rebound estimate of around 60\%. 
% Second, a smaller group of 12 studies using three other methods
% also had an average estimate of total rebound magnitude of over 60\%:
% non-CGE macroeconomic models
% (e.g., \citet{Barker2009} and \citet{Lemoine:2020aa}),
% econometric analysis (e.g., \citet{Wei2019}, \citet{Yan2019}, 
% and \citet{Bruns2019}), and
% productivity or growth accounting studies (e.g., \citet{Lin2015}).
% 
% Comparing one study to the next is complicated by 
% the wide variety of rebound analysis frameworks employed in rebound analysis.
% So before formally defining the scope and aims of this paper,
% one of which is consolidation of technical and economic foundations, 
% we survey existing rebound frameworks.

%   We use the word ``framework'' to mean 
%   the basic structure for analysis of a system or concept,
%   in this case energy rebound.
% }
% %
% have been developed for 
% microeconomic, macroeconomic, and total energy rebound.
% At the \emph{microeconomic} level,
% direct and indirect rebound are often estimated 
% via energy service price elasticities (e.g.,~\citet{Schipper2000}).
% Advances at the microeconomic level include those by 
% \citet{Thomas:2013aa}, who set out a detailed rebound analysis framework
% of direct and indirect microeconomic effects;
% \citet{Borenstein:2015aa}, who provided a detailed decomposition
% of rebound into income and substitution effects;
% \citet{Chan2015}, who analyzed welfare
% implications of the rebound effect; and
% \citet{Sun:2018aa}, who considered direct rebound, including device effects.
% However, lifecycle and end-of-life considerations are not typically included 
% in microeconomic rebound analysis frameworks, and 
% models of consumer preferences lack robustness.
% (\citet{Babacan:2020aa} provides a rare example 
% of analysis of life-cycle analysis effects of the energy efficient device.)
% 
% The importance of interactions between microeconomic and \emph{macroeconomic}
% rebound effects is suggested by the 
% %so-called 
% \emph{Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate} \citep{Saunders:1992aa}, 
% defined by \citeauthor{Herring1999} as
% ``increased energy-efficiency at the micro-economic level,
% while leading to a reduction of energy use at this level, 
% leads not to a reduction, but instead to an increase in energy use, 
% at the national, or macroeconomic level''~\citep[p.~214]{Herring1999}.
% \citeauthor{Borenstein:2015aa} described macro effects as follows:
% ``the economy [expands] by more than the private income gain
% enjoyed by the owner of the upgraded appliance'' \citep[p.~11]{Borenstein:2015aa}.
% To date, frameworks for estimating the magnitude of macroeconomic rebound effects
% have included an amplification mechanism from micro to macro, 
% the result of energy productivity gains
% from the energy efficiency upgrade (EEU) \citep{Dimitropoulos2007, Sorrell:2010ul}.
% These macro effects are hypothesized to operate 
% via a numerical multiplier~\citep{Borenstein:2015aa, Lange2019}.
% Discussions of a macro multiplier effect
% have been purely conceptual, 
% with the magnitude of the macro factor being a central issue.
% \citet{Howarth1997} and \citet{Schipper2000}
% claim the macroeconomic rebound multiplier effect is small. 
% \citet{Aucott2014}, \citet{Enflo2009}, and \citet{Bataille2017}
% are among those who claim the macroeconomic multiplier is much larger. 
% \citeauthor{Dimitropoulos2007} suggested
% ``[o]ne of the main reasons behind the debate is the lack of a rigorous theoretical framework
% that can describe the mechanisms and consequences of 
% the rebound effect at the macro-economic level''~\citep[p.~6354]{Dimitropoulos2007}.
% In a recent review on energy productivity, 
% \citeauthor{Elkomy2020} found
% ``[w]hile many researchers suggest that energy and productivity are linked, 
% there is relatively little consensus in the empirical literatures 
% either confirming or rejecting these views. 
% In some cases (notably the relationship between capital and energy), 
% we do not appear to have robust methodologies for making empirical assessments''~\citep[p.~1]{Elkomy2020}.
% 
% \citet{Saunders:1992aa} made perhaps the earliest attempt
% at a framework for \emph{total} energy rebound
% based on neoclassical aggregate production functions (APFs).
% Later works continued the APF approach, including
% \citet{Saunders:2000aa, Saunders2008},
% \citet{Wei2017}, and
% \citet{Brockway:2017a}.
% \citet{Grepperud2004} provide one of the first
% general equilibrium frameworks for total rebound,
% overcoming limitations of partial equilibrium frameworks where
% markets by definition cannot fully close 
% and thus miss some rebound channels~\citep{Figus2016}.
% Further general equilibrium studies of total rebound followed, including
% \citet{Wei2010},
% \citet{Lemoine:2020aa}, and
% \citet{Fullerton2020}.
% 
% Despite the growth of rebound contributions in micro, macro, and total frameworks,
% particularly in the last decade,
% several key issues remain. 
% First, limitations of \emph{microeconomic} rebound analysis frameworks include
% %
% \begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]
% 	
% 	\item inseparability of substitution and income effects when
% 	      in applied analysis of EEUs and
% 
%   \item the lack of an operationalizable link between micro and macro effects.
%     
% \end{enumerate*}
% 
% Second, there is a paucity of both theoretical and empirical work on the
% \emph{macroeconomic} multiplier.
% At least two things are unclear:
% the channel by which a macroeconomic multiplier effect 
% would couple to microeconomic effects 
% and 
% the appropriate magnitude of a macroeconomic multiplier.
% 
% Third, results from analysis frameworks which estimate \emph{total} rebound 
% are highly dependent upon two assumptions: 
% the type of utility function used (Cobb-Douglas, constant elasticity of substitution (CES), etc.) and
% the chosen value of the elasticity of substitution.
% As \citeauthor{Saunders2008} noted, the
% ``choice of production/cost function can pre-determine the results related to rebound \ldots{}
% [and choosing] values for these [elasticity of substitution] parameters
% is tantamount to assuming rebound results''~\citet[p.~2207-2208]{Saunders2008}.
% Furthermore, analysis frameworks at the total rebound level
% often work with aggregate energy and economic variables,
% rarely discriminating between microeconomic and macroeconomic rebound components.
% 
% In summary, most work on energy rebound is empirical and microeconomic.
% And although microeconomic theory is available,
% it is scattered across papers, and
% it has not been developed in a way that 
% allows simultaneous empirical estimation of all microeconomic rebounds.
% Furthermore, macroeconomic rebound and its links to micro rebound
% is virtually unexplored territory.
% This state of affairs
% inhibits understanding of rebound mechanisms
% at direct and indirect locations and micro and macro levels.
% In the absence of integrated theoretical foundations,
% macro energy modeling and energy efficiency policy are at risk
% of being ineffective to achieve efficiency-based CO$_2$ emissions reductions.
% Adding to that risk,
% energy rebound is rarely included in either 
% energy models~\citep{Brockway2021} or
% energy policy-making~\citep{fontvivanco2016},
% limiting our ability to assess the interactions among
% rebound, energy demand, and carbon emissions going forward.
% 
% Bringing these concerns together, further 
% %theoretical and empirical 
% research is vital
% to advance our understanding of energy rebound, 
% to formulate effective energy policy, and 
% to take appropriate climate change mitigation actions.

% %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
% 
% There is a strategic \emph{need} for a comprehensive rebound analysis framework
% to firm up theoretical foundations, enable empirical analysis, and

% In particular the framework should be one that 
% %
% \begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]

\section{Methods: development of the comprehensive rebound framework}
\label{sec:framework}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, we develop a comprehensive energy rebound analysis framework 
(concisely, ``the framework'').
We follow the rebound typology discussed in Section~\ref{sec:rebound_typologies}
and Table~\ref{tab:typology}, 
distinguishing between
microeconomic effects (at the single device or device owner level)
and 
macroeconomic effects (broader, economy-wide responses
to a single device upgrade).
(See \citet{greening2000}, \citet{Barker2009}, and \citet{FontVivanco2018}.) 
We follow others, including \citet{Jenkins2011} and \citet{Walnum2014}, 
in splitting microeconomic effects into 
direct and indirect locations.
Like other authors, we recognize many macroeconomic effects, 
even if we don't later distinguish among them.
\citet{Sorrell:2009cg} 
sets out five macroeconomic rebound effects:
embodied energy effects, respending effects, output effects, energy market effects, and composition effects.
\citet{Santarius2016} and \citet{Lange2021} 
introduce 
meso (i.e., sectoral) level rebound
between the micro and macro levels.
\citet{VandenBergh2011} distinguishes 14 types of rebound, 
providing, perhaps, the greatest complexity. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:flowchart} shows rebound effects
arranged in left-to-right order of their discussion in this paper.
Rebound symbols are shown above each effect ($Re_{empl}$, etc.).
Nomenclature for direct and indirect locations are shown beneath each effect ($Re_{dempl}$, etc.).
Decorations for each stage are shown between rebound effects
($\circ$, $*$, etc.).
Names for the decorations are given at the bottom of the figure
(``orig,'' ``star,'' etc.)%
\footnote{
  Note that
  the vocabulary and mathematical notation for rebound effects is extensive;
  Fig.~\ref{fig:flowchart} and Appendix~\ref{sec:nomenclature} provide guides to 
  notational elements used throughout this paper, including
  symbols, Greek letters, abbreviations, decorations, and subscripts.
  The notational elements 
  can be mixed to provide a rich and expressive ``language'' of energy rebound.
  In several places, we use colored backgrounds on rebound effects for visual convenience. 
}.
The left-to-right order does not necessarily represent 
the progression of rebound effects through time.

\subsection{Rebound effects}
\label{sec:rebound_mechanisms}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We assume an energy conversion device (say, a car)
that consumes final energy%
\footnote{
  Conventionally, stages of the energy conversion chain are 
  primary energy (e.g., coal, oil, natural gas, wind, and solar),
  final energy (e.g., electricity and refined petroleum),  
  useful energy (e.g., heat, light, and mechanical drive), and 
  energy services (e.g., transport, illumination, and space heating).
}
%
(say, gasoline) at a rate $\rbempl{E}$ (in MJ/year).
The final energy is available at price $p_E$ (in \$/MJ).
The energy conversion device provides a rate of energy service 
$\rbempl{q}_s$ (in vehicle-km/year)
with final-to-service efficiency $\bempl{\eta}$ (in km/MJ).
An energy efficiency upgrade (EEU) increases
final-to-service efficiency%
\footnote{
  Note that energy service efficiency ($\eta$) improves
  between the original ($\circ$) and
  post-emplacement ($*$)
  stages of Fig.~\ref{fig:flowchart}, remaining constant thereafter.
  Thus, $\orig{\eta} < \aempl{\eta} = \asub{\eta} = \ainc{\eta} = \amacro{\eta}$,
  as shown in Table~\ref{tab:analysis_assumptions}.
  We refer to all post-emplacement efficiencies 
  ($\aempl{\eta}$, $\asub{\eta}$, $\ainc{\eta}$, and $\amacro{\eta}$)
  as $\amacro{\eta}$
  to match the nomenclature of \citet{Borenstein:2015aa}.
  When convenient, the same approach to nomenclature is taken with other quantities such as 
  the capital cost rate ($\rate{C}_{cap}$) and 
  maintenance and disposal cost rate ($\rate{C}_{md}$).
}
such that
$\amacro{\eta} > \bempl{\eta}$,
possibly at an increased cost to
emplace (capital cost), maintain, and dispose of the device such that
$\amacro{C}_{cap} > \bempl{C}_{cap}$ and 
$\ramacro{C}_{\md} > \rbempl{C}_{\md}$.
(This is not a costless EEU.)
As final-to-service efficiency~($\eta$) increases,
the price of the energy service~($p_s$) declines.
The final energy price ($p_E$) is assumed exogenous
($\bempl{p}_E = \bsub{p}_E = \binc{p}_E = \bmacro{p}_E  = \amacro{p}_E$),
so the final energy purchaser (the device owner) is a price taker%
\footnote{
  Relaxing the exogenous final energy price assumption
  would require a full-economy model that is beyond the scope of this paper.
  Rebound due to energy price change is included in the macro effect.
  (See Table~\ref{tab:typology}.)
}.
%
Initially, the device owner spends income ($\rorig{M}$)
on final energy for the device ($\rorig{C}_s = p_E \rorig{E}_s$), 
annualized capital costs for the device ($\rorig{C}_{cap}$), 
annualized costs for maintenance and disposal of the device ($\rorig{C}_{\md}$), and 
other goods and services ($\rorig{C}_o$).
The budget constraint
for the device owner is

\begin{equation} \label{eq:budget_constraint}
  \rorig{M} = \rorig{C}_s + \rorig{C}_{cap} + \rorig{C}_{\md} + \rorig{C}_{o} + \cancelto{0}{\rorig{N}} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where 
original net savings ($\rorig{N}$) is zero.

Later (Sections~\ref{sec:empl_effect_main_paper}--\ref{sec:macro_effect_main_paper}), 
we walk through four rebound effects, 
deriving rebound expressions for each. 
But first 
we define rebound relationships 
(Section~\ref{sec:rebound_relationships}),  
show typical energy and cost relationships 
(Section~\ref{sec:energy_and_cost_relationships}), and 
discuss rebound path graphs
(Section~\ref{sec:rebound_path_graphs}.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Rebound relationships}
\label{sec:rebound_relationships}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Energy rebound is defined as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_def}
  Re \equiv 1 - \frac{\text{actual final energy savings rate}}{\text{expected final energy savings rate}} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where both actual and expected final energy savings rates are in \$/year 
and expected positive.
Final energy ``takeback'' rate is defined as expected final energy savings rate less 
actual final energy savings rate.
Note that the takeback rate can be negative, indicating that the actual final energy savings rate
is greater than the expected final energy savings rate, 
a condition called hyperconservation.
Thus,

\begin{equation}
  Re = 1 - \frac{\text{expected final energy savings rate} - \text{takeback rate}}{\text{expected final energy savings rate}} \; .
\end{equation}
%
Simplifying gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_takeback}
  Re = \frac{\text{takeback rate}}{\text{expected final energy savings rate}} \; .
\end{equation}
%
Thus, energy rebound can be given by either Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_def}) or Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_takeback}).

We define rebound at the final energy stage of the energy conversion chain,
because that is the point of energy purchase by the device owner.
To simplify derivations, 
we choose not to apply final-to-primary energy multipliers
to final energy rates in the numerators and denominators of rebound expressions
derived from Eqs.~(\ref{eq:Re_def}) and~(\ref{eq:Re_takeback});
they divide out anyway.
Henceforth, we drop the adjective ``final'' 
on the noun ``energy,''
unless there is reason to indicate a specific stage of the energy conversion chain.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Typical energy and cost relationships}
\label{sec:energy_and_cost_relationships}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

With the rebound notation of Appendix~\ref{sec:nomenclature}, 
four typical relationships emerge.
First, the consumption rate of the energy service~($\rate{q}_s$)
is the product of final-to-service efficiency~($\eta$) and
the rate of energy consumption by the energy conversion device~($\rate{E}_s$).
Typical units for automotive transport and illumination
(the examples in Section~\ref{sec:examples}) are shown
beneath each equation%
\footnote{
  Note that ``pass'' is short for ``passenger,'' and
  ``lm'' is the SI notation for the lumen, a unit of lighting energy rate.
}.

\begin{align} \label{eq:typ_qs_eta_Edot}
  \rate{q}_s &= \eta \rate{E}_s \\
  \text{[pass-km/yr]} &= \text{[pass-km/MJ]} \text{[MJ/yr]} \nonumber \\
  \text{[lm-hr/yr]} &= [\text{lm-hr/MJ}] \text{[MJ/yr]} \nonumber
\end{align}
%
Second, the energy service price~($p_s$) is the ratio of energy price~($p_E$) 
to the final-to-service efficiency~($\eta$).

\begin{align} \label{eq:ps_pE_eta}
  p_s &= \frac{p_E}{\eta} \\
  \text{[\$/pass-km]} &= \frac{[\$/\text{MJ}]}{\text{[pass-km/MJ]}} \nonumber \\
  \text{[\$/lm-hr]} &= \frac{[\$/\text{MJ}]}{\text{[lm-hr/MJ]}} \nonumber
\end{align}
%
Third, energy service expenditure rates~($\rate{C}_s$) are the product 
of energy price~($p_E$) and device energy consumption rates~($\rate{E}_s$).

\begin{align}
  \rate{C}_s &= p_E \rate{E}_s \\
  \text{[\$/yr]} &= \text{[\$/MJ]}\text{[MJ/yr]} \nonumber
\end{align}
%
Fourth, indirect energy rates~($\rate{E}_j$)
for maintenance and disposal ($j = \md$) and other goods expenditures ($j = o$)
are the product 
of expenditures rates~($\rate{C}_j$) and energy intensity of the economy~($I_E$).

\begin{align} \label{eq:indirect_energy_rates}
  \rate{E}_j &= \rate{C}_j I_E \\
  \text{[MJ/yr]} &= \text{[\$/yr]}\text{[MJ/\$]} \nonumber
\end{align}


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Rebound path graphs}
\label{sec:rebound_path_graphs}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Any comprehensive rebound analysis must track
energy, expenditure, and consumption
at the device (direct location) and elsewhere in the economy (indirect location)
across all adjustments for all rebound effects. 
One novel contribution of this paper is visualization of rebound effects 
in three spaces:
the energy space, the expenditure space, and the consumption space.
Each space is represented by a plane that contains a path graph that illustrates adjustments
to energy, expenditure, and consumption as a result of the EEU.
(See Appendix~\ref{sec:graph_details} for 
detailed mathematical descriptions of rebound path graphs.)
Important quantities for the path graphs are
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]
	
  \item direct and indirect energy consumption rates ($\rate{E}_{dir}$, $\rate{E}_{indir}$), 
  
  \item direct and indirect expenditure rates ($\rate{C}_{dir}$ and $\rate{C}_{indir}$), 
  
  \item the consumption rate of the energy service ($\rate{q}_s$), and
  
  \item the expenditure rate on other consumption goods ($\rate{C}_o$).
    
\end{enumerate*}
In rebound path graphs, direct effects are placed on the $x$-axis, and 
indirect effects are placed placed on the $y$-axis.

Figs.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}--\ref{fig:ExampleConsPathGraph} show
notional rebound path graphs on the energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces.
The notional path graphs are not quantified; there are no scales on the axes.
Later (Section~\ref{sec:examples}), 
rebound path graphs (with scales) illustrate the numerical examples.

Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph} shows a notional energy path graph, with 
the direct energy consumption rate ($\rate{E}_{dir}$) on the $x$-axis
and
the indirect energy consumption rate ($\rate{E}_{indir}$) on the $y$-axis.
Points $\circ$, $*$, $\wedge$, $-$, and $\sim$ represent the rebound stages
between the rebound effects,
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:flowchart}.
Points $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ represent intermediate stages.
Lines with negative slope through points 
$\circ$, $a$, $*$, $\wedge$, $-$, and $\sim$
indicate energy consumption isoquants
(sum of direct and indirect components) at key points.
Table~\ref{tab:path_graph_segments} shows 
segments and rebound effects for all rebound path graphs.

\end{table}

A notional expenditure path graph is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleCostPathGraph}, 
with 
the direct expenditure rate on the energy service ($\rate{C}_{dir}$) on the $x$-axis and 
the indirect expenditure rate ($\rate{C}_{indir}$) on the $y$-axis.
Lines with negative slope through points $\circ$, $a$, $*$, and $\wedge$
indicate expenditure isoquants (sum of direct and indirect components).

A notional consumption path graph is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleConsPathGraph}.
The indexed rate of energy service demand ($\rate{q}_s/\rbempl{q}_s$) is shown on the $x$-axis, and
the indexed rate of other goods demand ($\rate{C}_o/\rbempl{C}_o$) is shown on the $y$-axis.
Iso-cost loci of other goods and energy service demand (budget constraints)
are shown as lines with negative slope. 
Indifference curves are denoted by \iicirc{} and \iibar{}. 
A ray from the origin through the $\wedge$ point is denoted \rr{}.
Note that stages $\circ$, $a$, $b$, and $*$ collapse to the same point
on the consumption path graph, because both
the rate of energy service consumption and 
the rate of other goods consumption are
unchanged across the emplacement effect
($\raempl{q}_s = \rbempl{q}_s$ and $\raempl{C}_o = \rbempl{C}_o$, respectively).

\subsection{Rebound effects}
\label{sec:rebound_effects}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The four rebound effects shown in the rebound path graphs
(emplacement, substitution, income, and macro)
are discussed in subsections below.
In each subsection, we
define each rebound effect and
show mathematical expressions for rebound ($Re$) caused by each effect.
Detailed derivations of all rebound expressions 
can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:derivation}.
See, in particular, Tables~\ref{tab:empleffect}--\ref{tab:macroeffect},
which provide a parallel structure for energy and financial accounting
across all rebound effects.
In the subsections that follow, the notional graphs
(Figs.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}--\ref{fig:ExampleConsPathGraph})
serve to illustrate the development of the framework.
We begin with the emplacement effect.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{\Empleffect}
\label{sec:empl_effect_main_paper}
%------------------------------

The emplacement effect (segments \circa{}, \ab{}, and \bstar{} 
in Figs.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph} and~\ref{fig:ExampleCostPathGraph})
accounts for performance of the EEU only;
behavior changes are addressed later, 
in the substitution and income effects. 
The direct emplacement effects of the EEU include
device energy savings ($\Sdot$) and device energy cost savings ($\Delta \raempl{C}_s$),
on segments \circa{} in Figs.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph} 
and~\ref{fig:ExampleCostPathGraph}, respectively.
The indirect effects of EEU emplacement are
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]
	
  \item changes in the embodied energy rate ($\Delta \raempl{E}_{emb}$)
        (segment \ab{} in Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}), 
  
  \item changes in the capital expenditure rate ($\Delta \raempl{C}_{cap}$)
        (segment \ab{} in Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleCostPathGraph}), and 
        
  \item changes in the maintenance and disposal energy and expenditure rates 
        ($\Delta \raempl{E}_{\md}$ and $\Delta \raempl{C}_{\md}$)
        (segments \bstar{} in Figs.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph} and \ref{fig:ExampleCostPathGraph}).
    
\end{enumerate*}

The rate of energy savings
due to the direct emplacement effect  
($\Sdot$, segment \circa{} in Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph})
is given by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:S_dot_def}
  \Sdot \equiv \rbempl{E}_s - \raempl{E}_s = - \Delta \raempl{E}_s \; .
\end{equation}
%
$\Sdot$ can be rewritten conveniently as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Sdot}
  \Sdot = \Sdoteqn \; .
\end{equation}
%
(See Appendix~\ref{sec:Sdot}.)

Because behavior changes are not considered
in the direct emplacement effect,
actual and expected energy savings rates are identical, and there is no takeback.
By definition, then, the direct emplacement effect causes no rebound.
Thus, 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_dempl0}
  Re_{dempl} = 0 \; .
\end{equation}
%
In the notional energy path graph of Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}, 
point $a$ lies on the $Re_{tot} = 0\%$ line
indicating that point $a$ (and the $Re_{tot} = 0\%$ line) 
is the point from which all rebound effects 
($Re_{empl}$, $Re_{sub}$, $Re_{inc}$, and $Re_{\macro}$)
are measured.
If rebound effects cause 
total energy demand to return to the original energy consumption level 
(negative sloping line through the $\circ$ point), 
all expected energy savings are taken back by rebound effects. 
Thus, the line of constant energy consumption through the $\circ$ point is labeled
$Re_{tot} = 100\%$.
The contribution of each rebound effect to total rebound 
is the distance each component's segment moves across the rebound isoquants.  
Total rebound ($Re_{tot}$) is measured linearly between and beyond the
$Re_{tot} = 0\%$ and $Re_{tot} = 100\%$ lines, 
with direct rebound in the $x$ direction and 
indirect rebound in the $y$ direction.
The region below and to the left of the $Re_{tot} = 0\%$ line
in Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}
exhibits negative rebound, indicating hyperconservation.
The region above and to the right of the $Re_{tot} = 100\%$ line 
shows ``backfire,'' 
i.e.\ greater energy consumption after the EEU than before it. 

Although the direct emplacement effect does not cause rebound, 
Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph} shows that
indirect emplacement effects may indeed cause rebound.
Indirect emplacement effects 
(segments \ab{} and \bstar{}
in Figs.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph} and~\ref{fig:ExampleCostPathGraph}) 
account for the life cycle of the energy conversion device,
including energy embodied by manufacturing processes (subscript $emb$) and
maintenance and disposal activities (subscript $\md$).
In the notional energy path graph (Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}), 
emplacement rebound is negative ($Re_{empl} < 0$),
because the upgraded device has a lesser
embodied energy rate ($\raempl{E}_{emb} < \rbempl{E}_{emb}$)
and a lesser maintenance and disposal expenditure rate ($\raempl{C}_{\md} < \rbempl{C}_{\md}$)
than the original device.
Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleCostPathGraph} shows segments \ab{} and \bstar{}
moving in the negative direction,
consistent with a lower capital expenditure rate
($\raempl{C}_{cap} < \rbempl{C}_{cap}$) and 
a reduced maintenance and disposal expenditure rate
($\raempl{C}_{\md} < \rbempl{C}_{\md}$).

One of the unique features of this framework
is that independent analyses of embodied energy and 
capital costs of the EEU are expected.
We note that the different terms 
(embodied energy rate, $\rate{E}_{emb}$, and
capital cost rate, $\rate{C}_{cap}$)
might seem to imply different processes, 
but they actually refer to the same emplacement effect, 
namely energy segment \ab{} and expenditure segment \ab{} 
in energy and expenditure path graphs
(Figs.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph} and
\ref{fig:ExampleCostPathGraph}, respectively).
Purchasing an upgraded device
(which likely leads to $\rbempl{C}_{cap} \neq \raempl{C}_{cap}$)
will likely mean a changed embodied energy rate ($\rbempl{E}_{emb} \neq \raempl{E}_{emb}$) 
to provide the same energy service.
Our names for these aspects of rebound (embodied energy and capital cost)
reflect common usage 
in the energy and economics fields, respectively.
In the notional graphs of
Figs.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph} and~\ref{fig:ExampleCostPathGraph}, 
embodied energy rates and capital cost rates
(represented by energy segment \ab{} and expenditure segment \ab{}, respectively) 
move in the same direction (both negative).
However, both segments \ab{} could move in the positive direction, or
they could move in opposite directions, 
depending on the results of the independent analyses for 
embodied energy and capital cost rates.

Consistent with the energy/exergy analysis literature, 
we define embodied energy 
to be the sum of all final energy (direct and indirect) 
consumed in the production of the energy conversion device.
Energy is embodied in the device within manufacturing and distribution supply chains
prior to consumer acquisition of the device.
No energy is embodied in the device while in service.
The EEU causes the embodied energy of the energy conversion device to change
from $\orig{E}_{emb}$ to $\aempl{E}_{emb}$.

However, for simplicity, we spread all embodied energy
over the lifetime of the device
to provide a uniform embodied energy rate ($\rate{E}_{emb}$),
(We later take the same approach to capital costs ($\rate{C}_{cap}$) and
maintenance and disposal costs ($\rate{C}_{\md}$).)
A justification for spreading embodied energy purchase costs comes from considering
device replacements by many consumers across several years.
In the aggregate, evenly spaced (in time) replacements
work out to the same embodied energy in every period.

Thus, we allocate embodied energy over the life of the original and upgraded devices
($\bempl{t}_{\life}$ and $\aempl{t}_{\life}$, respectively)
to obtain embodied energy rates, such that
$\rbempl{E}_{emb} = \bempl{E}_{emb} / \bempl{t}_{\life}$
and 
$\raempl{E}_{emb} = \aempl{E}_{emb} / \aempl{t}_{\life}$.
The change in embodied final energy due to the EEU (expressed as a rate) is given by
$\Delta \raempl{E}_{emb} = \raempl{E}_{emb} - \rbempl{E}_{emb}$
and is shown as segment \ab{} in Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}.
The expression for embodied energy rebound is

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_emb}
  Re_{emb} = \Reembeqn{} \; .
\end{equation}

Embodied energy rebound ($Re_{emb}$)
can be either positive or negative, depending on 
the sign of the term
$(\aempl{E}_{emb}/\bempl{E}_{emb})(\bempl{t}_{\life}/\aempl{t}_{\life}) - 1$.
Rising energy efficiency can be associated with increased device complexity,
additional energy consumption in manufacturing, and
more embodied energy,
such that $\aempl{E}_{emb} > \bempl{E}_{emb}$ and $Re_{emb} > 0$,
all other things being equal.
However, if the upgraded device has longer life than the original device
($\aempl{t}_{\life} > \bempl{t}_{\life}$),
$\raempl{E}_{emb} - \rbempl{E}_{emb}$ could be negative,
meaning that the upgraded device has a lower embodied energy rate than the original device,
as shown by point \emph{2} being below point \emph{1} 
in the notional energy path graph of Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}.
See Appendix~\ref{sec:Re_emb} for details of the derivation.

In addition to embodied energy, 
indirect emplacement effect rebound accounts for
energy demanded by maintenance and disposal~($\md$) activities
(segments \bstar{} in Figs.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph} and~\ref{fig:ExampleCostPathGraph}).
Maintenance expenditures are typically modeled as a per-year expense, a rate (e.g., $\rbempl{C}_m$).
Disposal costs (e.g., $\bempl{C}_d$) are one-time expenses incurred 
at the end of the useful life of the energy conversion device.
Like embodied energy, we spread disposal costs across the lifetime 
of the original and upgraded devices ($\bempl{t}_{\life}$ and $\aempl{t}_{\life}$, respectively)
to form expenditure rates such that 
$\rbempl{C}_{\md} = \rbempl{C}_m + \bempl{C}_d/\bempl{t}_{\life}$
and
$\raempl{C}_{\md} = \raempl{C}_m + \aempl{C}_d/\aempl{t}_{\life}$.

For simplicity, we assume that maintenance and disposal
expenditures imply energy consumption
elsewhere in the economy at its overall energy intensity~($I_E$).
Therefore, the change in energy consumption rate caused by a change 
in maintenance and disposal expenditures
is given by $\Delta \raempl{C}_{\md} I_E = (\raempl{C}_{\md} - \rbempl{C}_{\md}) I_E$, 
shown as segment \bstar{} in Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}.
Rebound from maintenance and disposal activities 
is given by 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_md}
  Re_{\md} = \ReOMdeqn{} \; .
\end{equation}
%
See Appendix~\ref{sec:Re_OMd} for details of the derivation.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{\Subeffect}
\label{sec:sub_effect_main_paper}
%------------------------------

Neoclassical consumer theory decomposes price-induced
behavior change into
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]
	
  \item substituting energy service consumption for
        other goods consumption due to the lower post-EEU price of the energy service 
        (the substitution effect) and
  
  \item spending the higher real income (the income effect)%
        \footnote{
          For the original development of the decomposition
          see \citet{Slutsky1915} and \citet{Allen1936}.
          For a modern introduction see \citet{Nicholson2017}.
        }.
    
\end{enumerate*}
%
This section develops mathematical expressions 
for substitution effect rebound ($Re_{sub}$),
thereby accepting the standard neoclassical microeconomic assumptions
about consumer behavior.
(The next section addresses income effect rebound, $Re_{inc}$.)
The substitution effect alters compensated demand, which is the demand for
the expenditure minimizing consumption bundle that
maintains utility at the pre-EEU level, given the new prices.
Compensated demand is a technical term for a thought experiment from welfare economics: 
the device owner's budget is altered so that the owner is ``compensated''
for the change in price while maintaining the same level of utility as before. 
The change in the budget is called ``compensating variation'' (CV).
The substitution effect involves
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]

  \item an increase in consumption of the energy service,
        the direct substitution effect (subscript $dsub$) and

  \item a decrease in consumption of other goods,
        the indirect substitution effect (subscript $isub$).

\end{enumerate*}
%
Thus, two terms comprise substitution effect rebound,
direct substitution rebound ($Re_{dsub}$) and
indirect substitution rebound ($Re_{isub}$).
The substitution effect is shown by segments
\starc{} (indirect component) and \chat{} (direct component) 
in Figs.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}--\ref{fig:ExampleConsPathGraph}.

The substitution effect is best described 
with reference to a consumption path graph (Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleConsPathGraph}).
Prior to the EEU, the consumption basket (of the energy service and other goods)
is represented by the $\circ$ point, and 
the expenditure isoquant, the budget constraint, is \circcirc{}.
The \circcirc{} line is tangent to the lower indifference curve 
(\iicirc{}) at point $\circ$, the optimal consumption
bundle prior to the EEU.
After emplacement of the more efficient device
(but before the substitution effect), 
the price of the energy service decreases ($\aempl{p}_s < \bempl{p}_s$),
pivoting the budget constraint counterclockwise around the y-axis intercept.
The budget line \starstar{} indicates the
cost of purchasing the original consumption bundle
at the new prices.
The substitution effect indicates the cheaper, optimal
consumption bundle at the $\wedge$ point. 
This compensating variation
translates into a lower budget constraint \hathat{} 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleConsPathGraph}.
The $\wedge$ point shows consumption with new prices yielding utility
at the level prior to the EEU and minimizing expenditure, 
by consuming more of the now-lower-cost energy service
and less of the relatively more costly other goods.

Rebound from the substitution effect can also be decomposed into 
indirect (the decrease in other goods consumption, segment \starc{}) 
and 
direct (the increase in energy service consumption, segment \chat{})
components.
The impact of the substitution effect on energy consumption rates and expenditure rates
can be seen in Figs.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}
and~\ref{fig:ExampleCostPathGraph}, respectively.

An approximate utility model
is often used in the literature
(e.g., see \citet[p.~17, footnote~43]{Borenstein:2015aa})
for determining 
the post-substitution effect point
and therefore $Re_{dsub}$ and $Re_{isub}$.
The approximate utility model assumes that 
the compensated energy service price elasticity of energy service demand ($\eqspsC$) and
the compensated energy service cross-price elasticity of other goods demand ($\eqopsC$)
are constant along an indifference curve.
Whether that is true depends on the utility function used.
Constant price elasticities (as in the approximate utility model)
are approximations that are in general only applicable to marginal price changes. 
Appendix~\ref{sec:Resub_approximate_method}
contains details of the approximate utility model.

Here, we present an exact utility model that allows 
the compensated energy service price elasticity of energy service demand ($\eqspsC$) and
the compensated energy service cross-price elasticity of other goods demand ($\eqopsC$)
to vary along an indifference curve, 
allowing analysis of non-marginal energy service price changes ($\orig{p}_s >\!\!> \aempl{p}_s$). 
We employ a fully specified CES utility model,
which allows the direct calculation
of the utility maximizing consumption bundle for any constraint.
The utility model describes the device owner's behavior as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ces_utility}
  \frac{\rate{u}}{\rbempl{u}} = \cesutility{} \; .
\end{equation}

The device owner's utility
(relative to the original condition, $\rate{u}/\rorig{u}$)
is determined by
the consumption rate of the energy service ($\rate{q}_s$) and
the consumption rate of other goods and services ($\rate{C}_o$).
The share parameter ($\fCs$) is taken from the original (pre-EEU) consumption basket.
The exponent $\rho$ is calculated from the (constant) elasticity of substitution ($\sigma$) 
as $\rho \equiv (\sigma - 1)/\sigma$.
All quantities are normalized to pre-EEU values so that
the cost share of other goods can be used straightforwardly 
in empirical applications rather than having
to construct quantity and price indices.
The normalized specification is commonly used in empirical CES \emph{production}
function applications \citep{Klump2012,Temple2012,Gechert2021}.
See Appendix~\ref{sec:utility_and_elasticities}
for further details of the CES utility model.

Direct substitution effect rebound ($Re_{dsub}$) is

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_dsub_def}
  Re_{dsub} = \frac{\Delta \rasub{E}_s}{\Sdot} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
which can be rearranged to

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_dsub_prelim}
  Re_{dsub} = \frac{\frac{\rasub{q}_s}{\rbempl{q}_s} - 1}{\frac{\amacro{\eta}}{\bempl{\eta}} - 1} \; .
\end{equation}

Indirect substitution effect rebound ($Re_{isub}$) is given by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_isub_def}
  Re_{isub} = \frac{\Delta \rasub{C}_o I_E}{\Sdot} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
which can be rearranged to 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_isub_prelim}
  Re_{isub} = \frac{\frac{\rasub{C}_o}{\rorig{C}_o} - 1}{\etaratiostacked - 1} \; 
                          \etaratiostacked \; 
                          \frac{\rbempl{C}_o I_E}{\rbempl{E}_s} \; .
\end{equation}

To find the post-substitution effect point ($\wedge$),
we solve for the location on the \iicirc{} indifference curve
where its slope is equal to the slope of the
\starstar{} expenditure line, 
assuming the CES utility model%
\footnote{
  Other utility models could be used.
  However, the Cobb-Douglas utility model is inappropriate for this framework, 
  because it assumes that the sum of substitution and income rebound is 100\% \emph{always}.
  Regardless of the utility model, expressions for
  $\rasub{q}_s/\rorig{q}_s$ and
  $\rasub{C}_o/\rorig{C}_o$
  must be determined
  and substituted into Eqs.~\ref{eq:Re_dsub_prelim} and~\ref{eq:Re_isub_prelim}.
}.
The results are

\begin{equation} \label{eq:q_s_solution}
  \frac{\rasub{q}_s}{\rbempl{q}_s} = \qssolution{}
\end{equation}
%
and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C_o_solution}
  \frac{\rasub{C}_o}{\rbempl{C}_o} = \Cosolution{} \; .
\end{equation}

Eq.~(\ref{eq:q_s_solution}) can be substituted directly
into Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_dsub_prelim})
to obtain an expression for direct substitution rebound ($Re_{dsub}$)
via the CES utility model.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_dsub_CES}
  Re_{dsub} = \RedsubCES{}
\end{equation}

Eq.~(\ref{eq:C_o_solution}) can be substituted directly
into Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_isub_prelim})
to obtain an expression for indirect substitution rebound ($Re_{isub}$)
via the CES utility model.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_isub_CES}
  Re_{isub} = \ReisubCES{}
\end{equation}

See Appendix~\ref{sec:Resub_exact_method} for details
of the derivations of Eqs.~(\ref{eq:Re_dsub_prelim}), 
(\ref{eq:Re_isub_prelim}), and 
(\ref{eq:q_s_solution})--(\ref{eq:Re_isub_CES}).


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{\Inceffect}
\label{sec:inc_effect_main_paper}
%------------------------------

The monetary income rate of the device owner ($\rbempl{M}$)
remains unchanged across the rebound effects, 
such that
$\rbempl{M} = \raempl{M} = \rasub{M} = \rainc{M} = \ramacro{M}$.
Thanks to the energy service price decline, real income rises, 
and freed cash from the EEU is given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:G_dot})
as $\rate{G} = p_E \Sdot$. 
Emplacement effect expenditures and compensating variation
modify freed cash to leave the device owner with
\emph{net} savings ($\rasub{N}$) from the EEU,
as shown in Eq.~(\ref{eq:N_dot_after_sub}).
Derivations of expressions for freed cash from the 
emplacement effect ($\rate{G}$)
and net savings after the substitution effect ($\rasub{N}$)
are presented in Tables~\ref{tab:empleffect} and~\ref{tab:subeffect}.
Rebound from the income effect quantifies the rate of additional energy demand 
that arises when the energy conversion device owner spends net
savings from the EEU
(segments \hatd{} and \dbar{} in 
Figs.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}--\ref{fig:ExampleConsPathGraph}), 

Additional energy demand from the income effect
is determined by several constraints.
The income effect under utility maximization
satisfies the budget constraint, so that
net savings are zero after
the income effect ($\rainc{N} = 0$).
The budget constraint can be seen in 
expenditure path graphs (e.g., Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleCostPathGraph})
where the post-income-effect point ($-$) returns to the original expenditure isoquant.
See Appendix~\ref{sec:proof_income_elasticities}
for a mathematical proof that the income preference equations below
(Eqs.~(\ref{eq:qsrat_eqsM}) and~(\ref{eq:qorat_eqoM}))
satisfy the budget constraint.

A second constraint is that net savings are spent completely on
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]
	
  \item additional spending on the energy service ($\rainc{q}_s > \rbinc{q}_s$, segment \hatd{}) and
  
  \item additional spending on other goods ($\rainc{q}_o > \rbinc{q}_o$, segment \dbar{}).
    
\end{enumerate*}
%
This constraint is satisfied by construction below.

The proportions in which income-effect spending is allocated depends on preferences, 
which prescribe an income expansion. 
The CES utility function 
allocates spending on the energy service and other goods in the same proportion as post-substitution-effect 
expenditures on the energy service and other goods,
due to its homotheticity, 
so that the income expansion path is a ray (\rr{}) on consumption path graphs.
This constraint is satisfied by construction below, 
particularly via an effective income ($\Mdothatprime$).
In the consumption path graph, the pre- and post-income-effect 
points ($\wedge$ and $-$, respectively)
lie along ray \rr{} from the origin through point $\wedge$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleConsPathGraph}.
However, this framework could accommodate non-homothetic preferences
for spending across the income effect (turning the income
expansion path into a more general curve).

We next show expressions for 
direct and indirect income effect rebound.

%..............................
\paragraph{Direct income effect} 
\label{sec:direct_income_effect}
%..............................

The income elasticity of energy service demand ($\eqsM$)
quantifies the amount of net savings spent 
on more of the energy service ($\rainc{q}_s > \rbinc{q}_s$).
(See Appendix~\ref{sec:utility_and_elasticities} 
for additional information about elasticities.)
Spending of net savings on the energy service 
leads to direct income effect rebound ($Re_{dinc}$).

The ratio of rates of energy service consumed across the income effect is given by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:qsrat_eqsM}
  \incprefseqn \; .
\end{equation}
%
Homotheticity means that $\eqsM = 1$, 
but not all net savings ($\rbinc{N}$) are spent on more energy for the energy conversion device.
The increased consumption rate of the energy service is 
represented by segments \hatd{} 
in Figs.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}--\ref{fig:ExampleConsPathGraph}.

Effective income ($\Mdothatprime$) is given by 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:effective_income}
  \effinceqn{} \; .
\end{equation}
%
For the purposes of the income effect, 
the effective income equation (Eq.~(\ref{eq:effective_income})) 
adjusts income ($\rorig{M}$) to account for 
sunk costs ($\raempl{C}_{cap}$ and $\raempl{C}_{\md}$) and
net savings ($\rasub{N}$).

Direct income rebound is defined as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_dinc_def}
  Re_{dinc} \equiv \frac{\Delta \rainc{E}_s}{\Sdot} \; .
\end{equation}
%
(See Table~\ref{tab:inceffect}.)
After substitution, rearranging, and canceling of terms (Appendix~\ref{sec:Re_dinc}), 
the expression for direct income rebound is

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_dinc}
  Re_{dinc} = \Redinceqnexact{} \; .
\end{equation}
%
If there is no net savings after the substitution effect ($\rasub{N} = 0$), 
direct income effect rebound is zero ($Re_{dinc} = 0$), as expected%

\paragraph{Indirect income effect} 
\label{sec:indirect_income_effect}
%..............................

The income elasticity of other goods demand ($\eqoM$)
quantifies the amount of net savings spent 
on additional other goods ($\rainc{q}_o > \rbinc{q}_o$).
Spending of net savings on other goods and services
leads to indirect income effect rebound ($Re_{iinc}$).

The ratio of rates of other goods consumed across the income effect is given by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:qorat_eqoM}
  \incprefoeqn \; 
\end{equation}
%
and is represented by segments \dbar{} 
in Figs.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}--\ref{fig:ExampleConsPathGraph}.
Under the assumption that prices of other goods are exogenous
(see Appendix~\ref{sec:other_goods_expenditures}), 
the ratio of rates of other goods consumption ($\rainc{q}_o/\rbinc{q}_o$)
is equal to the ratio of rates of other goods expenditures ($\rainc{C}_o/\rbinc{C}_o$)
such that 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Corat_eqoM}
  \frac{\rainc{C}_o}{\rbinc{C}_o} = \left( 1 + \frac{\rasub{N}}{\Mdothatprime} \right)^{\eqoM} \; .
\end{equation}
%
Homotheticity means that $\eqoM = 1$.
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:inceffect}, indirect income rebound is defined as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_iinc_def}
  Re_{iinc} \equiv \frac{\Delta \rainc{C}_o I_E}{\Sdot} \; .
\end{equation}
%
After substitution, rearranging, and canceling of terms, 
the expression for indirect income rebound is

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_iinc}
  Re_{iinc} = \Reiinceqnexact{} \; .
\end{equation}
%
See Appendix~\ref{sec:Re_inc} for details of the derivation
of cirect and indirect income effect rebound.

\subsubsection{\Macroeffect}
\label{sec:macro_effect_main_paper}
%------------------------------

The previous rebound effects 
(emplacement effect, substitution effect, and income effect)
are microeconomic in nature. 
However, the changes at the micro level have important implications at the macro level,
including economic expansion.
As the price level in the economy falls, 
demand for goods grows, and the economy grows. 
Efficiency-driven economic expansion is
described by \citeauthor{Hulten1978}'s theorem,
which states that the economy grows at the rate 
of an efficiency increase in some part of the economy, 
scaled by that part's share in gross output~\citep{Hulten1978}.
\citet{blackburn2020energy}  
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]
	
  \item show that Hulten's theorem also applies to factor-augmenting technical change and
  
  \item express rebound as a scale effect.
    
\end{enumerate*}

However, the scale effect is static and does not account for
dynamic, long-run effects induced by the EEU%
\footnote{
  In fact, considerable empirical evidence in the context
  of critiquing real business cycle models shows that
  short-run effects of technological improvements on inputs (in that literature: labor)
  are contractionary \citep{Basu2006,Ramey2016hb}.
}.
Our framework incorporates annual average effects over 
the lifetime of the upgraded device, 
so dynamic effects that take time to unfold matter.
To describe all the mechanisms by which these dynamic effects operate, 
the literature distinguishes among several macro rebound effects:
a scale effect, a structural change effect, employment and investment effects, 
and further price effects \citep{Colmenares2020,Brockway2021}.
As \citet{VanBenthem2015} notes, 
cheaper energy services facilitate the development and 
deployment of new products (product innovation),
an important driver of rising aggregate demand \citep{Szostack1995}. 
Ultimately, these dynamic phenomena lead to 
higher incomes and more spending on goods and energy services than 
otherwise would have been the case in the absence of the EEU.

\citeauthor{Borenstein:2015aa} has addressed these macro effects from the demand side,
noting that ``income effect rebound will be larger economy-wide than 
would be inferred from evaluating only the direct income gain from 
the end user's transaction'' \citep[p.~11]{Borenstein:2015aa} and 
likening it to the Keynesian macroeconomic multiplier.
However, the dynamic macro rebound effect 
is not an autonomous expansion of expenditure in an otherwise unchanged economy 
(like the Keynesian multiplier).
Rather, macroeconomic rebound is caused by an energy productivity improvement,
a supply-side shock.
It takes less energy to generate the same economic output, because 
energy efficiency has improved.
That said, \citeauthor{Borenstein:2015aa} is right to highlight that supply-side 
and demand-side effects both play a role as the consequences of the
technology shock play themselves out.
Furthermore, his approach has the advantage that it can be directly
linked to our income effect and its consequences for macroeconomic rebound. 
\citet{Borenstein:2015aa} also notes that scaling from net 
savings ($\rasub{N}$) at the device level
to productivity-driven growth at the macro level is unexplored territory.

One contribution of this paper is the first 
operationalization of the macro rebound multiplier idea.
To operationalize the macro rebound effect, we scale
the net savings gained by the device owner at the micro level ($\rasub{N}$)
by a macro factor ($k$) that represents the economic activity generated
by the infinite series of respending of the net savings throughout the economy%
\footnote{
  $k$ has units of \$ of economic growth created per \$ of spending 
  by the device owner in the income effect ($\rbinc{N}$).
}.
%
The macro factor ($k$) can be likened to 
the total respending derived from
a marginal propensity to consume ($\MPC$).
$k$ represents spending in the broader economy 
after the income effect has occurred
and is not tied to any particular EEU or economic sector.
$k \ge 0$ is expected.
$k = 0$ means there is no dynamic effect
resulting from the energy efficiency upgrade.
$k > 0$ means that productivity-driven macroeconomic growth has occurred
with consequent implications for additional energy consumption in the economy.
(See Appendix~\ref{sec:income_macro_mpc} 
for the mathematical relationship between $k$ and $\MPC$.)

A further advantage of using the $\MPC$ approach is that there are
many estimates of its magnitude, though we stress again that  $\MPC$ is a
\emph{representation} of the effect, while the cause is higher
energy efficiency on the supply side.
A recent review by \citet{Carroll2017} 
reports that most empirical estimates show $\MPC$ between 0.2 and 0.6, 
with the full range estimates spanning zero to 0.9.
For now, we choose $\MPC = 0.5$ and $k = 1$ as a placeholder value,
with further exploration of the macro effect
in Sections~\ref{sec:effect_of_macro_factor} 
and~\ref{sec:macro_rebound_discussion}.
We assume as a first approximation
(and with \citet{Antal:2014aa} and \citet{Borenstein:2015aa}) that macro effect spending
implies energy consumption according to 
the average energy intensity of the economy ($I_E$).
Macro rebound is given by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_macro_def}
  Re_{\macro} = \frac{k \rbinc{N} I_E}{\Sdot} \; .
\end{equation}
%
(See Table~\ref{tab:macroeffect}.) 
The macro effect is shown as segment \bartilde{}
in Fig.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}.
After some algebra (Appendix~\ref{sec:Re_macro}), 
we arrive at an expression for macro effect rebound:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_macro}
  Re_{\macro} = \Remacroeqn{} \; .
\end{equation}
%

\subsection{Rebound sum}
\label{sec:total_rebound_main_paper}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The sum of all rebound emerges from the four rebound effects
(emplacement effect, substitution effect, income effect, and macro effect).
Macro effect rebound~($Re_{\macro}$, Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_macro}))
is expressed in terms of other rebound effects.
(Derivation details can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:total_rebound}.)
After algebra and canceling of terms,
we find

\begin{align} \label{eq:Re_tot}  
  Re_{tot} = \; \Retoteqn{} \; .
\end{align}

\section{Two applications of the rebound framework}
\label{sec:examples}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To demonstrate application of the comprehensive rebound analysis framework
developed in Section~\ref{sec:framework},
we select two case studies:
energy efficiency upgrades to a car and an electric lamp.
We first collect parameter values
for the equations for
eight rebound components:
$Re_{dempl}$ (Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_dempl0})),
$Re_{emb}$ (Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_emb})),
$Re_{\md}$ (Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_md})),
$Re_{dsub}$ (Eqs.~(\ref{eq:Re_dsub_prelim} and~\ref{eq:q_s_solution})),
$Re_{isub}$ (Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_isub_prelim} and~\ref{eq:C_o_solution})),
$Re_{dinc}$ (Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_dinc})),
$Re_{iinc}$ (Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_iinc})), and
$Re_{\macro}$ (Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_macro})).
The total rebound 
%sum 
($Re_{tot}$)
is given by the sum of the above components,
which can also be verified against Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_tot}).

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:macro_effect_main_paper},
the link between macroeconomic and microeconomic rebound effects 
is largely unexplored. 
For now, we assume a placeholder value of $k = 1$ for both case studies.
We return to the matter of calibrating $k$
in the Discussion (Section~\ref{sec:discussion}).

@

For the first example, 
we consider the purchase of a more fuel efficient car, 
namely a gasoline-electric Ford Fusion Hybrid car,
to replace a conventional gasoline Ford Fusion car. 
The cars are matched as closely as possible, 
except for the inclusion of an electric battery 
in the hybrid car.  
The car case study features a larger initial capital investment
versus the long-term benefit of decreased direct energy costs 
for the same energy service (miles/year). 


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Input parameters} 
\label{sec:Car_input_data}
%------------------------------

We require four sets of data. 
First, the basic car parameters are summarized 
in Table~\ref{tab:car_parameters}.
Second, we require several general parameters, 
mainly relating to the U.S.\ economy and personal finances 
of the average U.S.\ citizen. 
The parameters and the values used in the car example 
are given in Table~\ref{tab:car_economic_parameters}.
Third, we require elasticity parameters, 
as given in Table~\ref{tab:car_elasticity_parameters}.
Fourth, armed with the parameter values from 
Tables~\ref{tab:car_parameters}--\ref{tab:car_elasticity_parameters}, 
and the equations of Section~\ref{sec:framework},
we calculate important values at each rebound stage,
as shown below in Table~\ref{tab:car_stages_table}.
Note that Table~\ref{tab:car_stages_table} applies to the car owner.
Across the macro effect (segment \bartilde{} in Fig.~\ref{fig:CarEnergyGraph}), 
changes occur only in the macroeconomy.
For the car owner, no changes are observed across the macro effect.
Thus, the $-$ (bar) and $\sim$ (tilde) columns
of Table~\ref{tab:car_stages_table} are identical.

Results are represented graphically in quantified energy, cost, and consumption path graphs
in Figs.~\ref{fig:CarEnergyGraph}--\ref{fig:CarConsGraph}.
The energy path graph (Fig.~\ref{fig:CarEnergyGraph})
shows the size of each rebound effect
for the car example.

The \empleffect{} has three components:
the direct emplacement effect, 
the embodied energy effect, and 
the maintenance and disposal effect.
Rebound from the direct emplacement effect 
($Re_{dempl}$) is \Sexpr{Re_dempl_car_char_perc}\% always, 
because energy takeback (and, therefore, rebound)
occurs after the EEU is emplaced.
Indirect rebound due to the embodied energy effect
($Re_{emb}$) is \Sexpr{Re_emb_car_char_perc}\%,  
due to the higher embodied energy rate
($\Delta \raempl{E}_{emb} = \Sexpr{Delta_E_dot_emb_star_car_char}$~MJ/year)
stemming from the electric battery in the hybrid EV car.
Rebound due to the maintenance and disposal effect
($Re_{\md}$) is small and negative
($\Sexpr{Re_md_car_char_perc}$\%),
because of the slightly lower maintenance and disposal costs
for the hybrid EV car.

The \subeffect{} has two components:
direct and indirect substitution effect rebound.
Rebound from direct substitution ($Re_{dsub}$) is 
positive, as expected (\Sexpr{Re_dsub_car_char_perc}\%). 
The car owner will, on average, prefer more driving, 
because of fuel economy enhancements (\Sexpr{mpg_better}~mpg $>$ \Sexpr{mpg_worse}~mpg).
In other words, with no other changes, 
the more fuel efficient car increases driving by \Sexpr{Re_dsub_car_char_perc}\%. 
Conversely, the indirect substitution effect ($Re_{isub}$)
is slightly negative ($\Sexpr{Re_isub_car_char_perc}$\%)
to achieve the same level of utility after increased driving. 
Indeed, less money is spent on other goods
($\Delta \rasub{C}_o = \Sexpr{Delta_C_dot_o_hat_car_char}$~\$/year).

The \inceffect{} also has two components:
direct and indirect income effect rebound.
The car owner obtains freed cash 
due to a net monetary savings from the emplacement and substitution effects. 
The direct income effect
($Re_{dinc}$) is positive
(\Sexpr{Re_dinc_car_char_perc}\%), 
because the car owner allocates some
freed cash to additional driving. 
Rebound from the indirect income effect 
($Re_{iinc}$) is positive (\Sexpr{Re_iinc_car_char_perc}\%)
due to higher spending on other goods. 
Thus, the net income after the substitution effect
($\rasub{N} = \Sexpr{N_dot_hat_car_char}$~\$/year) 
translates into positive direct and indirect income
rebound at the micro scale. 
Total micro rebound (emplacement, substitution, and income effects)
sums to $Re_{micro} = \Sexpr{Re_micro_car_char_perc}$\%.

Finally, 
%at the macro level, 
the \macroeffect{} leads to macro rebound
($Re_{\macro}$) of \Sexpr{Re_macro_car_char_perc}\%
with $k$ assumed to be 1,
due to economic expansion caused by 
productivity enhancements arising from the more-efficient provision of the 
energy service (transportation).

For our second example, 
we consider purchasing a light emitting diode (LED) electric lamp
to replace a baseline incandescent electric lamp. 
Both lamps are matched as closely as possible 
in terms of energy service delivery (measured in lumen output per lamp), 
the key difference being the energy required to provide that energy service. 
The LED lamp has a low 
initial capital investment rate
(less than the incumbent incandescent lamp, actually!)
and a long-term benefit of decreased direct energy expenditures
for the same annual energy service (lm-hr/year).

\subsubsection{Input parameters} 
\label{sec:lamp_input_data}
%------------------------------

Again, we require four sets of data. 
First, the basic lamp parameters are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:lamp_parameters}. 
Second, we require several general parameters, 
mainly relating to the U.S.\ economy and 
personal finances of the average U.S.\ citizen. 
The parameters and the values used in the lamp example 
are given below in Table~\ref{tab:lamp_economic_parameters}.
Third, we require the elasticity parameters, 
as shown in Table~\ref{tab:lamp_elasticity_parameters}.
Fourth, with the parameter values from 
Tables~\ref{tab:lamp_parameters}--\ref{tab:lamp_elasticity_parameters} 
and the equations of Section~\ref{sec:framework} in hand,
we calculate important values at each rebound stage,
as shown below in Table~\ref{tab:lamp_stages_table}.
Similar to Table~\ref{tab:car_stages_table}, 
Table~\ref{tab:lamp_stages_table} applies to the lamp owner.
For the lamp owner, no changes are observed across the macro effect.
Thus, the $-$ (bar) and $\sim$ (tilde) columns
of Table~\ref{tab:lamp_stages_table} are identical.

The \empleffect{} rebound components are as follows:
the direct emplacement effect ($Re_{dempl}$) 
is always $\Sexpr{Re_dempl_lamp_char_perc}$\%.
Indirect rebound due to the embodied energy effect
($Re_{emb}$) is $\Sexpr{Re_emb_lamp_char_perc}$\%.
Although the LED lamp has higher embodied energy 
($\aempl{E}_{emb} = \Sexpr{E_emb_star_lamp_char}$~MJ)
than the incandescent lamp 
($\bempl{E}_{emb} = \Sexpr{E_emb_orig_lamp_char}$~MJ),
the LED lamp has a much longer lifetime,
meaning that the LED embodied energy rate 
($\raempl{E}_{emb} = \Sexpr{E_dot_emb_star_lamp_char}$~MJ/year)
is less than the incandescent embodied energy rate
($\rbempl{E}_{emb} = \Sexpr{E_dot_emb_orig_lamp_char}$~MJ/year).
Thus, the change in embodied energy rate ($\Delta \raempl{E}_{emb}$)
is $\Sexpr{Delta_E_dot_emb_star_lamp_char}$~MJ/year, 
and embodied energy rebound is negative
($Re_{emb} = \Sexpr{Re_emb_lamp_char_perc}$\%).
Rebound due to the maintenance and disposal effect
($Re_{\md}$) is \Sexpr{Re_md_lamp_char_perc}\%,
because we assume no difference in maintenance and disposal costs between 
the incandescent lamp and the LED lamp%
\footnote{
  Maintenance cost rates for both incandescent and LED lamps are likely to be equal, because both are negligible;
  lamps are usually installed and forgotten.
  Real world disposal cost differences between the incandescent and LED technologies
  are also likely to be negligible. 
  However, if ``disposal'' includes recycling processes, 
  cost rates may be different between the two technologies
  due to the wide variety of materials in LED lamps compared to incandescent lamps.
}.

Direct \subeffect{} rebound 
($Re_{dsub}$) is \Sexpr{Re_dsub_lamp_char_perc}\%
due to the much higher LED lamp efficacy
($\aempl{\eta} = \Sexpr{eta_better}$~lm/W) 
compared to the incandescent lamp
($\bempl{\eta} = \Sexpr{eta_worse}$~lm/W),
leading to increased demand for lighting
(from $\rbsub{q}_s = \Sexpr{q_dot_s_star_lamp_char}$~lm-hr/year
to $\rasub{q}_s = \Sexpr{q_dot_s_hat_lamp_char}$~lm-hr/year)
as shown by segment \chat{} in Fig.~\ref{fig:LampConsGraph}.
To maintain constant utility, 
consumption of other goods is reduced
($\Delta \rasub{C}_o = \Sexpr{Delta_C_dot_o_hat_lamp_char}$~\$/year), 
as shown by segment \starc{} in Fig.~\ref{fig:LampConsGraph},
yielding indirect substitution effect rebound
($Re_{isub}$) of $\Sexpr{Re_isub_lamp_char_perc}$\%.

\Inceffect{} rebound arises from spending net energy cost savings
associated with converting from the incandescent lamp to the LED lamp
($\rbinc{N} = \Sexpr{N_dot_hat_lamp_char}$~\$/year).
Direct income effect rebound 
($Re_{dinc}$) is \Sexpr{Re_dinc_lamp_char_perc}\%,
positive but small, 
as the lamp owner allocates 
some of the additional income to increased demand for lighting. 
The indirect income effect rebound is large
($Re_{iinc} = \Sexpr{Re_iinc_lamp_char_perc}$\%), 
due to the energy implications of increased spending on other goods.
Total micro rebound (emplacement, substitution, and income effects)
sums to $Re_{micro} = \Sexpr{Re_micro_lamp_char_perc}$\%.

Finally, rebound due to the macroeconomic 
\macroeffect{} 
($Re_{\macro}$) is coincidentally also \Sexpr{Re_macro_lamp_char_perc}\%
with $k$ assumed to be 1,
due to economic expansion caused by 
productivity enhancements arising from the more-efficient provision of the 
energy service (lighting).
%(It is a coincidence that $Re_{\macro}$ has the same value as $Re_{iinc}$to 1 decimal place for the lighting example.)

\subsection{Sensitivity analyses}
\label{sec:sensitivity_analyses}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Sensitivity analyses show the effect of 
independently varied parameters on total rebound and rebound components.
In the context of this framework,
sensitivity analyses
can show important trends, tendencies, and relationships
between rebound parameters and rebound magnitudes.
Key rebound parameters include 
post-EEU efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$),
capital cost ($\amacro{C}_{cap}$),
energy price ($p_E$),
price elasticity of energy service demand ($\eqspsUC$), 
and the macro factor ($k$).
Sensitivity analyses must be undertaken carefully,
because rebound parameters are not expected to be 
independent of each other.

In each subsection below, a series of graphs
shows the effects of varying each of these five key rebound parameters
($\amacro{\eta}$, 
$\amacro{C}_{cap}$, 
$p_E$, 
$\eqspsUC$, 
and $k$)
on total energy rebound ($Re_{tot}$) and its components
($Re_{emb}$, $Re_{md}$, $Re_{dsub}$, $Re_{isub}$,
$Re_{dinc}$, $Re_{iinc}$, and $Re_{\macro}$).
In the graphs, 
nominal values for the rebound parameters are shown as points, 
and sensitivity trends are shown as lines. 
A limitation of each sensitivity analysis 
is noted at the end of each subsection.

Fig.~\ref{fig:eta_tilde_takeback_Sdot_sens_graph} shows that
both the energy takeback rate and expected energy savings ($\Sdot$)
increase with post-EEU efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$), 
but the relationship is asymptotic.
Each unit increase of fuel economy or lighting efficacy is less effective than
the previous unit increase of fuel economy or lighting efficacy
for saving energy.
At very high levels of fuel economy economy or lighting efficacy, 
a unit increase leads to almost no additional energy savings.
Thus, we can say there are diminishing returns of fuel economy and lighting efficacy,
leading to saturation of energy savings at very high levels of fuel economy and lighting efficacy.
A simple example illustrates.
A $\bempl{\eta} = 25$ mpg car drives $\bempl{q}_s = 100$ miles 
using $\bempl{E}_s = 4$ gallons of gasoline.
A more-efficient car ($\amacro{\eta} = 30$ mpg) is expected to use
$\aempl{E}_s = 3.33$ gallons to drive the same distance,
a savings of $\Sdot = 0.67$ gallons.
Another 5 mpg boost in efficiency (to $\amacro{\eta} = 35$ mpg)
will use $\aempl{E}_s = 2.86$ gal to drive 100 miles, 
a further expected savings of only $\Sdot = 0.47$ gallons.
Each successive 5 mpg boost in fuel economy 
is expected to save less energy than the previous 5 mpg boost in fuel economy

Saturation can be seen mathematically, too.
Taking the limit as $\amacro{\eta} \rightarrow \infty$ 
in Eq.~(\ref{eq:Sdot}) gives $\Sdot = \rbempl{E}_s$, 
not $\infty$. 
Thus, efficiency saturation must occur.
Fig.~\ref{fig:eta_tilde_takeback_Sdot_sens_graph}
shows that the framework correctly replicates the
expected efficiency saturation trends.

Saturation is especially noticeable in the lamp example
compared to the car example,
the difference being that 
the LED lamp is already much more efficient than the incandescent lamp
(\Sexpr{lamp_efficacy_ratio}$\times$),
whereas the hybrid car is only 
\Sexpr{car_efficiency_ratio}$\times$ as efficient as the conventional gasoline car. 
Thus, at $\amacro{\eta} = \Sexpr{efficacy_better}$ lm-hr/W-hr, 
the energy efficient LED
is far closer to efficiency saturation than the hybrid vehicle 
(at $\amacro{\eta} = \Sexpr{mpg_better}$ mpg).
As a result, further increases in the LED lamp's efficiency 
are less effective than further increases in the hybrid car's efficiency.

That said, actual savings is the difference between the expected energy savings line (solid line)
and the takeback line (dashed line) in Fig.~\ref{fig:eta_tilde_takeback_Sdot_sens_graph}.
Because the gap between the lines grows, 
higher efficiency yields actual energy savings,
even after accounting for rebound effects.
But the actual savings are always less than expected savings, due to takebacks.

Fig.~\ref{fig:eta_tilde_takeback_Sdot_sens_graph} shows that
expected energy savings ($\Sdot$) increase faster than takeback 
as $\amacro{\eta}$ increases.
Thus, total rebound ($Re_{tot}$, the ratio of 
takeback rate to expected energy savings rate in Eq.~\ref{eq:Re_takeback}),
decreases as efficiency grows.
The lamp exhibits a relatively smaller rebound decline with efficiency,
because the lamp example is closer to saturation than the car example.

Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_eta_graph} shows the variation of all rebound components
with post-EEU efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$).
In the car and lamp examples, 
direct substitution rebound ($Re_{dsub}$) is the 
rebound component 
most sensitive to changes in post-EEU efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$).

A limitation of the energy efficiency sensitivity analysis is that 
post-EEU efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$)
is unlikely to be independent of other factors, 
such as capital cost ($\amacro{C}_{cap}$).

Note that the sensitivity analysis on post-upgrade efficiency 
($\amacro{\eta}$, Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_eta_graph})
is the only sensitivity analysis that requires careful explication
of both the numerator and denominator of Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_takeback}),
as in Fig.~\ref{fig:eta_tilde_takeback_Sdot_sens_graph}, 
because both the numerator and denominator of Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_takeback})
change when post-upgrade efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$) changes.
The denominator of Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_takeback}) doesn't change for
the sensitivity analyses of Figs.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_C_cap_graph}--\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_k_graph}.
Thus, for the remaining sensitivity analyses, 
when the rebound percentage increases (decreases), 
the energy takeback rate in the numerator of Eq.~(\ref{eq:Re_takeback})
increases (decreases) proportionally.

\subsubsection{Effect of capital cost ($\amacro{C}_{cap}$)} 
\label{sec:effect_of_capital_cost}
%------------------------------

The sensitivity of energy rebound
to capital cost ($\amacro{C}_{cap}$) is shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_C_cap_graph}.
All other things being equal,
as capital cost of the EEU rises, 
less cash is freed by the EEU,
leading to smaller income, macro, and total rebound.
The same effects would be observed
with increasing maintenance and disposal cost rate ($\ramacro{C}_{\md}$).

A limitation of the capital cost sensitivity analysis is that
capital cost ($\amacro{C}_{cap}$) is unlikely to be
independent of $\amacro{\eta}$.
Within a given energy efficiency technology
(e.g., hybrid cars or LED lamps),
greater capital cost ($\amacro{C}_{cap}$) may be associated with
greater service efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$).
$\amacro{C}_{cap}$ and $\amacro{\eta}$ should probably be varied jointly,
not independently.

\subsubsection{Effect of energy price ($p_E$)}

  dplyr::filter(Case == "Lamp - Germany") %>% 
  dplyr::select("Re_tot")
@


The effect of energy price on rebound is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_p_E_graph}.
Increasing energy prices lead to larger total rebound ($Re_{tot}$),
because higher energy prices lead to more freed cash 
to be re-spent by the device owner.
All other things being equal, more freed cash leads to 
more spending on other goods and services that demand energy.

Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_p_E_graph} also 
shows the effect of energy price ($p_E$)
on all rebound components.
Most rebound components increase with energy price, 
with the car and lamp examples exhibiting different sensitivities. 
Substitution effects ($Re_{dsub}$ and $Re_{isub}$)
are the only rebound components that decrease with energy price ($p_E$).
Substitution effects decrease with energy price, because 
at high energy price, less behavior adjustment is needed to re-equilibrate

  For the lamp example,
  the electricity price in Germany is taken as 0.3 \euro{}/kW-hr for the 2018 price of a household using 3.5~MWh/year,

All other things being equal, 
if U.S.\ residents paid Germany's energy prices,
energy rebound would be

for the car example and 
$\Sexpr{formatC(unlist(Lamp_Germany_Re_tot * 100), digits = 3)}$\%
for the lamp example, assuming $k = 1$.

A limitation of the energy price sensitivity analysis arises from the fact that
energy price is not independent of other parameters.
Indeed, other rebound parameters
would change along with energy price
(especially if moving from one country to another),
including capital cost ($\amacro{C}_{cap}$), 
maintenance and disposal expenditure rate ($\ramacro{C}_{\md}$),
energy intensity of the economy ($I_E$), and
energy service consumption rate ($\rbempl{q}_s$).

\subsubsection{Effect of elasticity ($\eqspsUC$)} 
\label{sec:effect_of_elasticity}
%------------------------------

Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_eps_graph} shows the variation of total rebound ($Re_{tot}$)
with the uncompensated price elasticity of energy service demand ($\eqspsUC$).
The effect is exponential:
total rebound increases with larger negative values of $\eqspsUC$, as expected.
The lamp example shows stronger exponential variation than the car example.
Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_eps_graph} shows that direct substitution rebound 
($Re_{dsub}$) is the most sensitive rebound component to changes in $\eqspsUC$.
For the lamp example, indirect income rebound ($Re_{iinc}$) also increases
substantially with $\eqspsUC$, 
because freed cash increases substantially with $\eqspsUC$ in the lamp example. 

A limitation of the elasticity sensitivity study derives from limitations of the 
CES utility model itself, which constrains price elasticity variation
given an elasticity of substitution.
Uneconomic conditions should be avoided.
For example, negative direct substitution rebound ($Re_{dsub} < 0$)
is obtained when $\left| \eqspsUC \right| < \fCs$,
because Eq.~(\ref{eq:sigma}) pushes 
the elasticity of substitution negative ($\sigma < 0$).
In reality, smaller negative (closer to 0) price elasticity ($\eqspsUC$)
would correlate with a smaller fraction of expenses spent on the energy service ($\fCs$), 
thereby avoiding the uneconomic condition.
However, a univariate sensitivity study cannot capture this effect and is
best used for smaller variations in $\eqspsUC$.

\subsubsection{Effect of macro factor ($k$)} 
\label{sec:effect_of_macro_factor}
%------------------------------

The sensitivity of energy rebound 
to the macro factor ($k$) is shown 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_k_graph}.
The macro factor has a linear effect on total rebound ($Re_{tot}$)
through the macro rebound component ($Re_{\macro}$).
All other rebound components are constant when $k$ is varied independently.

A limitation of the macro factor sensitivity analysis is that
the macro factor ($k$) is unlikely to be 
independent of $I_E$, because 
different values of $k$ imply a different macro-economy.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, we highlight several novel characteristics
of the comprehensive rebound analysis framework.
Next, we show how the framework enables insights
on energy policy, especially policies to encourage energy efficiency. 
Finally, we discuss and calibrate the macro factor ($k$).


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Novel aspects of the framework}
\label{sec:framework_novelties}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We recall the contributions raised 
in Section~\ref{sec:aim_contribution_structure}.
First, the framework developed in Section~\ref{sec:framework}
contributes the first comprehensive rebound analysis framework
that 
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]
	
  \item includes capital cost, embodied energy and maintenance and disposal effects and
  
  \item accommodates non-marginal energy service price decreases and
        non-marginal energy efficiency increases.
    
\end{enumerate*}
%
The embodied energy and maintenance and disposal effects
are the energy manifestation of the important difference 
between costless technology upgrades or (costly) mandated efficiency 
increases \citep{Gillingham:2013aa,Fullerton2020} and are not typically 
included in microeconomic rebound frameworks \citep{Azevedo2014,Gillingham:2020aa}.
Most rebound analysis frameworks assume costless upgrade in both financial and energy terms.
One surprising result is that taking account of differential capital cost can increase long-run
rebound as the rate of capital cost declines (see lamp example). Therefore the
no-capital cost rebound need not be an upper bound as was previously suggested \citep{Thomas:2013ab}.

The accommodation of non-marginal energy service price decreases and
non-marginal energy efficiency increases is
made possible by the direct calculation of consumption positions 
using Eqs.~\ref{eq:q_s_solution}--\ref{eq:Re_isub_CES}, rather than relying on
elasticities. The possibility of decomposing direct and indirect rebound effects into 
substitution and income effects was outlined by \citet{Khazzoom1980}, 
spelled out clearly by \citet{greening2000}, and some
numerical magnitudes approximated by \citet{Borenstein:2015aa}. 
Yet, past operational investigations of microeconomic rebound
typically show only stylized graphs of indifference curves in the consumption space, 
even if they are numerically precise in other respects 
\citep{Thomas:2013aa,Moshiri2017,Li2018}.

Second, this paper contributes the first visualizations of rebound effects
in energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces. 
We call these visualizations ``rebound path graphs,'' and
they can be seen in Figs.~\ref{fig:CarEnergyGraph}--\ref{fig:LampConsGraph}. 
Our precisely drawn, quantified rebound path graphs
through energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces
aid comprehension of and intuition about the various rebound effects.

Finally, the framework contributes the first operational link between 
rebound effects on macroeconomic and microeconomic scales. 
We both operationalize the link and show the location where it should be applied
(scaling net income after the substitution effect).
We further draw upon the MPC literature to show how macro effects 
operate via economic expansion over the long term.
This micro-to-macro link can be see in Eq.~\ref{eq:Re_macro_def} and
Figs.~\ref{fig:ExampleEnergyPathGraph}, \ref{fig:CarEnergyGraph}, and \ref{fig:LampEnergyGraph}.

\subsection{Policy considerations}
\label{sec:policy}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We take for granted that it is desirable
to reduce energy consumption via energy efficiency to reduce CO$_2$ emissions.
For energy efficiency to be as effective as possible, rebound should be minimised.
The sensitivity analyses of Section~\ref{sec:sensitivity_analyses}
enable exploration of several policy options that are often suggested
to promote energy efficiency:
energy efficiency standards, rebates or subsidies, and carbon taxes.
In the subsections below, 
we discuss the rebound implications of each policy option with reference to the sensitivity analysis
of Section~\ref{sec:sensitivity_analyses}.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Energy efficiency standards} 
\label{sec:policy:standards}
%------------------------------

Energy efficiency standards mandate minimum energy efficiency levels for selling into a market.
One example of energy efficiency standards is the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) 
standards for U.S.\ cars.

Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_eta_graph} shows that rebound falls
as post-upgrade energy efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$) rises. 
This result is driven mainly by a declining 
direct rebound effect as efficiency rises (Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_eta_graph}), 
in turn driven by declining own price elasticity of energy service demand ($\eqspsUC$). 
As a result, raising the minimum efficiency 
required to participate in a market is beneficial
for reducing energy consumption.
Indeed, Fig.~\ref{fig:eta_tilde_takeback_Sdot_sens_graph} shows the gap between 
the expected energy savings rate and the takeback rate grows with efficiency, so
absolute energy savings are expected to increase as efficiency grows.
However, Fig.~\ref{fig:eta_tilde_takeback_Sdot_sens_graph} shows that 
the takeback rate increases with efficiency, so caution is merited.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Rebates or subsidies} 
\label{sec:policy:rebates_or_subsidies}
%------------------------------

Larger efficiency increases can require higher capital investment within a given technology.
To encourage market penetration of higher-efficiency devices, 
rebates or subsidies can be offered to device purchasers to incentivize adoption of 
energy-efficiency technologies and grow their markets.
Doing so effectively reduces the capital cost of energy efficient devices ($\amacro{C}_{cap}$).
However, Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_C_cap_graph} shows that reducing capital cost 
increases energy rebound, 
the route being, predominantly, the income effect 
where more net savings are available to spend on 
more of the energy service and other goods.
Thus, policymakers should be aware that rebound will 
reduce the effectiveness of rebates and subsidies
to generate actual energy savings. 
%We note in passing that the framework accommodates 
%both costless upgrades and a costly ``policy-induced'' 
%improvement \citep{Gillingham2016}.

To avoid rebound generated by rebates or subsidies, 
policymakers may want to implement energy taxes, 
effectively raising the price of energy,
the topic of the next section.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Carbon price or energy taxes} 
\label{sec:splicy:energy_taxes}
%------------------------------

A carbon price or other penalty on consuming (fossil) energy (enacted 
alongside the EEU) reduces net savings
earned by device owners after the EEU
by raising the effective price of fossil energy and the price 
of any fossil energy-powered energy service,
such as a hybrid or internal combustion engine car.
By raising the relative price of the energy service,
the substitution effect shrinks. However, increasing the price of energy 
means that subsequent increases in energy efficiency, e.g. by later
buyers of the upgraded device provide increased net savings.
Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_p_E_graph} shows that energy rebound rises with energy price.
The route to higher rebound from rising energy prices 
is through the income and macro effects (assuming non-zero macro factor ($k$)).
Thus, policymakers should be aware that raising 
energy prices may not be as effective 
as presumed, due to rebound effects.
The picture becomes more complicated as more consumers may buy 
more-efficient devices or consider substitutes to avoid 
the price penalty, increasing the rate of absolute
savings. Moreover, higher energy prices are likely
to induce energy-saving technical change as well as structural change towards an overall 
less energy-intensive economy which could be designed by
policy makers with complementary policies to increase the availability of 
substitutes (e.g. more public transport). This in turn could lead to
a boost to economic growth and larger macro rebound effects, to which
we now turn.

@

The framework relates  macroeconomic rebound 
to microeconomic rebound 
via a term that scales magnitudes in the microeconomic portion of the framework. 
Few rebound studies have explored the macro space 
between micro and total rebound.
Inspired by \citet{Borenstein:2015aa} and others, 
we bridge macro and micro with the macro factor ($k$), 
as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:macro_effect_main_paper}.
For the results presented in Section~\ref{sec:examples}, 
we assumed a placeholder value of $k = 1$,
meaning that every \$1 spending by the device owner in the income effect
generates \$1 of additional economic activity in the broader economy.
However, the framework presented in Section~\ref{sec:framework} and
the results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:examples}
allow, for the first time, some initial discussion about a calibrated value for $k$.

To calibrate the macro factor ($k$),
we treat macro rebound ($Re_{\macro}$) as a residual.
The macro factor ($k$) becomes an unknown parameter whose value is to be chosen
such that $Re_{\macro}$
is sufficient to achieve an expected value for total rebound ($Re_{tot}$).
We take the expected value for $Re_{tot}$ from 
\citet{Brockway2021} who surveyed 33 recent studies to find
average total rebound of $Re_{tot} = \Sexpr{Re_tot_expected*100}\%$%
\footnote{
  The relevance of this value is confirmed by three studies that 
  appeared around the time of \citet{Brockway2021}.
  \citet{Yan2019} report 87\% short run and 78\% long-run average rebounds for Chinese provinces.
  \citet{blackburn2020energy} report average total rebound between
  52\% and 77\% for the US for plausible values
  of the elasticity of substitution.
  \citet{Berner2021} report 78\% to 101\% for several Western European countries and the U.S.\
  after two years.
}.
%
The calibrated values of $k$ that give identical $Re_{tot} = \Sexpr{Re_tot_expected*100}$\% 
for both examples are
$k = \Sexpr{formatC(calibrated_k[["Car"]], digits = 2)}$
for the car example and
$k = \Sexpr{formatC(calibrated_k[["Lamp"]], digits = 2)}$ 
for the lamp example.

Difference in input-ouput network centrality as well as the considerable 
variance in $Re_{tot}$ in 33 surveyed studies 
indicates that total rebound from one EEU is likely to be different from 
total rebound from another EEU. 
For the purposes of illustration we set $k = 3$,
being between the values of $k$ 
estimated from the car and lamp examples.
Note that $k = 3$ implies that 
every \$1 of net savings spent by the device owner
generates \$3 of additional economic 
activity in the broader economy.
We multiply $k \rasub{N}$ by the energy intensity of the economy to 
find the energy implications of respending in the economy.
There are three ways to interpret $k = 3$.
First, $k = 3$ can be considered to be the average long-run 
economic growth generated by the owner spending each \$1 of net savings,
or three times over the growth implied by applying Hulten's theorem.
Efficiency increases in equipment drive a significant part of 
long-run productivity growth \citep{Greenwood1997}; moreover, sectoral shocks
can have large aggregate consequences due to complementarities and network
effects \citep{Acemoglu2012,Atalay2017}. Therefore a large, long-run multiplier
is plausible.
Second, it could be that growth is less than 
\$3 but that the macroeconomic ``energy price effect" (a decline in 
energy prices due to the fallen demand) induces consumption at a higher
energy intensity than that of the pre-EEU economy. 
Third, from the demand-side perspective
entertained by \citet{Borenstein:2015aa}, 
$k = 3$ could be interpreted as $\MPC = 0.75$. 
(See Appendix~\ref{sec:income_macro_mpc}.)
$\MPC = 0.75$ is a reasonable number, 
being in the upper half of recent estimates by \citet{Carroll2017}.
While the cause of the growth in economic activity and energy is a 
supply-side productivity shock,
the subsequent demand-side effects may well be interpreted as a multiplier
effect, but reacting to initial higher real, rather than monetary, income.

After calibrating $k = 3$, we see that choosing a placeholder value of $k = 1$
underestimated $Re_{\macro}$ and, therefore, $Re_{tot}$.
In Figs.~\ref{fig:CarEnergyGraph} and~\ref{fig:LampEnergyGraph},
the macro effect segments (\bartilde{})
should be three times longer than they appear.
In Tables~\ref{tab:car_results} and~\ref{tab:lamp_results},
the values of macro rebound ($Re_{\macro}$) should triple to
\Sexpr{formatC(Re_macro_car_k_3*100, digits = 3)}\% and
\Sexpr{formatC(Re_macro_lamp_k_3*100, digits = 3)}\%, and
the values of total rebound ($Re_{tot}$) should increase to 
\Sexpr{sprintf("%.1f", round(Re_tot_car_k_3*100, 1))}\% and
\Sexpr{formatC(Re_tot_lamp_k_3*100, digits = 3)}\%
for the car and lamp examples,
respectively.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this paper,
we developed a comprehensive rebound analysis framework that
combines all rebound effects, locations, and scales
across energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces with 
a detailed model of consumer preferences and
non-marginal energy service price changes
in an operational manner
for the 
simplest case of a single fuel and a single energy service.
This paper also contributes the first visualizations of 
rebound path graphs in energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces.
We operationalize and calibrate the macro factor ($k = 3$)
to provide a better link between macro and micro effects. 

From the development and application of the framework, 
we draw four important conclusions.
First, the car and lamp examples (Section~\ref{sec:examples}) show that
        the framework enables
        quantification of magnitudes of all microeconomic rebound effects, including 
        direct and indirect locations 
        for emplacement, substitution, and income effects.
Second, the examples show that magnitudes of rebound effects
        vary with the type of energy efficiency upgrade performed.
Third, the sensitivity studies
        (Section~\ref{sec:sensitivity_analyses})
        enable evaluation of rebound sensitivities to important parameters. 
        For the examples in this paper, total rebound is   
        more sensitive to
        the price of energy ($p_E$),
        the elasticity of energy service demand ($\eqspsUC$), and
        the macro factor ($k$) 
        than either
        energy efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$) or
        the capital cost ($\amacro{C}_{cap}$) of the upgraded device.
Last, the discussion (Section~\ref{sec:discussion}) shows that
        rebound is a headwind for efficiency-led energy reduction and CO$_2$ mitigation policies.
        Quantification of rebound effect magnitudes
        is an important precursor to devising effective energy policies
        that would 
        encourage energy efficiency, 
        limit rebound effects, and
        reduce CO$_2$ emissions.

Future work could be pursued in several areas. 
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]
	
  \item Other utility models (besides the CES utility model) 
        could be explored for the substitution effect.
  
  \item Further empirical studies could be performed
        to estimate the magnitude of different 
        rebound effects in a range of real-life case studies.

  \item Deeper study of macro rebound is needed, including improved estimates 
        for the macro factor ($k$) and its relation to the MPC.
        The rebound effects of the distribution of $\MPC$ values 
        across various socioeconomic groups~\citep{Carroll2017}
        could be explored.

  \item The framework could be extended to producer-sided energy rebound effects.
    
  \item The framework presented here could be embedded 
        in energy-economy models to better include rebound effects
