%% Abstract %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{abstract}
A concise and factual abstract is required.
The abstract should state briefly 
the purpose of the research, 
the principal results, and
major conclusions. 
An abstract is often presented separately from the article, 
so it must be able to stand alone.
For this reason, References should be avoided, but if essential, 
then cite the author(s) and year(s).
Also, non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but
if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself.
\end{abstract}


%% Keywords %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% maximum of 6 keywords, using American spelling and avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts 
% (avoid, for example, 'and', 'of'). Be sparing with abbreviations: 
% only abbreviations firmly established in the field may be eligible. 
% These keywords will be used for indexing purposes.

% Up to 6 standard JEL codes. The available codes may be accessed at JEL,

\subsection{Question, contribution, and benefits (MKH, 100 words)}
\label{sec:questions_contribution}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This paper answers the question:
\emph{Is it possible to develop a comprehensive framework for energy rebound?} 
We believe the answer is ``yes.''
Thus, this paper's contribution to the rebound literature is
the presentation of a quantitative, micro-economic 
energy-economy rebound analysis framework, 
a ``comprehensive rebound framework'' for short.
The comprehensive rebound framework provides the following benefits:
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item it untangles and clarifies interrelated aspects of energy rebound,
  
  \item it unifies several concepts of energy rebound,
  
  \item it enables analysis of energy policy options, 
        thereby providing insight to the energy policymaking process.
    
\end{enumerate*}

Provide highlights of the framework here.
Refer to \ref{sec:derivation} for the detailed mathematical derivation of the framework.

\section{Calculations: an example (PB, 2000 words)}
\label{sec:example}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Focus on automobiles with at least two options.
Reference \citet{Borenstein:2015aa} for some energy efficiency and cost parameters.
The different options should yield large and small rebound
to provide insulation from reviewers' nit-picking 
about any specific rebound numbers that we calculate.

Thus,

Device rebound ($Re_{dev}$) is obtained from

\begin{equation}
  Re_{dev} = 1 - \frac{\mathrm{actual \; energy \; savings \; rate}}{\mathrm{expected \; energy \; savings \; rate}} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}
%
and
%
\begin{equation}
  Re_{dev} = 0 \; .
\end{equation}
%
After only the device effect and before any other effects, 
there are no energy takebacks. 
Thus, $Re_{dev} = 0$.

Use the monetary constraint ($\rbdev{M} = \radev{M}$) to obtain
%
\begin{align} \label{eq:M_dot_bal_device}
  p_E &\rbdev{E}_s + \cancel{\rbdev{C}_{cap}} + \cancel{\rbdev{C}_{\OMd}} + \cancel{\rbdev{C}_o} + \cancelto{0}{\rbdev{N}} \nonumber \\
      &= p_E \radev{E}_s + \cancel{\radev{C}_{cap}} + \cancel{\radev{C}_{\OMd}} + \cancel{\radev{C}_o}  + \radev{N} \; .
\end{align}
%
Prior to the device effect, there are no monetary savings from the EEU, so $\rbdev{N} = 0$.
For the device effect, 
changes in $\rate{C}_{cap}$, $\rate{C}_{\OMd}$, and $\rate{C}_o$ are neglected.
Thus, several terms are canceled in Eq.~\ref{eq:M_dot_bal_device}.
(Changes in $\rate{C}_{cap}$, $\rate{C}_{\OMd}$, and $\rate{C}_o$ 
are assigned later to the life cycle effect.)
Thus, 
%
\begin{equation}
  \Delta \radev{N} = \radev{N} - \cancelto{0}{\rbdev{N}} = p_E(\rbdev{E}_s - \radev{E}_s) = p_E (-\Delta \radev{E}_s) \; .
\end{equation}
%
Substituting Eq.~\ref{eq:Sdot_def} gives
%
\begin{equation}
  \Delta \radev{N} = p_E \Sdot \; .
\end{equation}
%
$\Delta \radev{N}$ represents the gross energy cost savings ($\rate{G}$) from the EEU, 
before any energy takeback occurs. 
Thus, 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:G_dot}
  \rate{G} = p_E \Sdot \; .
