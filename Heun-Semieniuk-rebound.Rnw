\subsection{Relevant previous work}
\label{sec:previous_work}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

\citet{Thomas:2013aa, Thomas:2013ab} look at household spending 
to ascertain embodied energy effects 
of spending energy cost savings in the economy. 

\Bt{} developed expressions for changes in final energy demand
due to substitution and income effects,
and he calculated, numerically, estimates for substitution and income rebound 
for example energy efficiency upgrades.
\Bt{} mentioned embodied energy, but 
he did not develop an expression for it, 
nor did he make estimates of its magnitude.
He mentioned a ``macroeconomic multiplier'' but did not include it 
in his expressions or numerical estimates.
And, he stopped short of obtaining explicit, symbolic expressions for 
rebound from embodied energy, substitution, and income effects.

Our approach has some differences from the work of \Tt{} and \Bt{}.
In contrast to \Tt{}, 
we account for potential differences in embodied energy between the original and upgraded device.





We spread embodied energy and initial and disposal costs
        across the service life of the device,
        thereby assuming that the analysis applies for a ``typical year''
        of the device.
        (\Bt{} didnâ€™t account for varying service life
        in his theory and equations, although
        service life was considered in example calculations.)
        Our approach allows for service life differences between the original and upgraded devices.

We choose not to apply time-value-of-money considerations to the financial aspects of the model.
        (\Ba{} discounted some cost streams in his examples.)
        This decision simplifies the derivation, provides consistency in the treatment of energy and money,
        and avoids questions about whether time valuation should be applied to \emph{energy} as well.
  
We choose not to apply final-to-primary energy multipliers 
        to final energy rates in the numerators and denominators of rebound expressions. 
        (\Ba{} applied final-to-primary energy multipliers which divide out, anyway.)
        This decision simplifies derivations.

\subsection{Contribution of this work}
\label{sec:contribution}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this paper, we extend the work of \Bt{} in several important ways.
%
\begin{enumerate}

  \item We develop explicit, symbolic rebound expressions for four effects on rebound:
        device-level effects, embodied energy effects, substitution effects, and income and respending effects.
        Doing so enables both indentification of important factors for rebound and
        explication of interactions among the different rebound effects.
  
  \item We add a macroeconomic multiplier ($k$) to describe technology changes.
        Doing so allows quantification of the effects of technology changes on rebound.

  \item We include embodied energy effects in our theory. 
        We estimate embodied energy effects on rebound and compare to other effects to ascertain 
        the importance of embodied energy.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Extending the Borenstein model}
\label{sec:extending_borenstein}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Like \Bt{}, we assume that 
a device (say, an automobile) consumes final energy ($E_f$, say gasoline) 
to provide energy services (vehicle miles) 
at rate $\ratebefore{q}_s$ (in miles/year)
with final-energy-to-services efficiency $\before{\eta}$ (in miles/gallon).
An energy efficiency upgrade ($U$) increases
final-energy-to-services efficiency such that 
$\after{\eta} > \before{\eta}$,
typically, but not always,
at an increased financial cost to procure, operate, maintain, and dispose the device
such that $\rateafter{C}_{dev} > \ratebefore{C}_{dev}$.%
\footnote{
  Following \Bt{}, 
  a symbol without decoration (e.g., $\before{X}$) indicates $X$ before the energy efficiency upgrade ($U$).
  $\after{X}$ indicates $X$ after $U$.
  $\rate{X}$ indicates the rate of $X$ before $U$ in units of $X$/year.
  $\rateafter{X}$ indicates the rate of $X$ after $U$ in units of $X$/year.
}
The upgraded device may also contain more embodied final energy
than the original
such that $\after{E}_{\femb} > \before{E}_{\femb}$.
$U$ reduces the service price such that $\after{p}_s < \before{p}_s$, 
freeing cash to be spent elsewhere 
at the energy intensity of the broader economy ($I_{E_f}$).
The reduced service price may also lead to substitution of spending
away from other purchases
toward final energy to operate the device.
The strength of the substitution dynamic is described 
by the service price elasticity of final energy demand ($\epsilon$), 
which is typically less than 0.

Our derivations of
explicit, symbolic expressions for the four rebound effects discussed above 
(device-level effects, embodied energy effects, substitution effects, and income and respending effects)
are provided in the Appendix, Section~\ref{sec:model_derivation}.
We summarize and discuss the expressions below.
(Note that Section~\ref{sec:model_verification} provides, where possible,
verification of the explicit, symbolic expressions 
using data from \Ba{}'s auto efficiency example.)

Device-level rebound ($Re_{dev}$) is given by 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_dev}
  Re_{dev} = \Redevequation{} \, ,
\end{equation}
%
where
final-energy-to-services efficiencies 
before and after $U$ are given by $\before{\eta}$ and $\after{\eta}$, respectively, and
$\epsilon$ is the energy service price elasticity of final energy demand.

Embodied energy rebound ($Re_{emb}$) is given by
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_emb}
  Re_{emb} = \Reembequation{} \, ,
\end{equation}
%
where 
$E_{\femb}$ is final energy embodied in the device in MJ,
$t$ is device lifetime in years, 
$\rate{E}_{\femb}$ is embodied final energy spread across the life of the device in MJ/year,
and
$\rate{E}_{\fdir}$ is the rate of final energy consumed directly by the device in MJ/year.

Substitution effect rebound ($Re_{sub}$) is given by 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_sub}
  Re_{sub} = \Resubequation{} \, ,
\end{equation}
%
where
$p_{E_f}$ is the price of final energy in \$/MJ and
$I_{E_f}$ is the final energy intensity of the economy in MJ/\$.

Rebound from income and respending effects is given by 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_ir}
  Re_{ir} = \Reirequation{} \, ,
\end{equation}
%
where
$\gamma = \gammaequation{}$ is the nondimensionalized change in device cost rate, 
$\rate{C}_{dev}$ is the cost to procure, operate, maintain, and dispose of the device
expressed as a rate,
and
$k$ is a nondimensional economic multiplier that accounts for 
the economic expansion caused by $U$.

Total energy rebound is the sum of $Re_{emb}$, $Re_{sub}$, and $Re_{ir}$.
After algebraic rearrangement, 
total energy rebound can be expressed as 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Re_tot}
  Re = \Retotequation{} \, .
\end{equation}

The symbolic expression for energy rebound in Equation~\ref{eq:Re_tot} 
allows explication of the factors that contribute to total energy rebound and
thereby represents an extension of the work of \Bt{}.
In particular, Equation~\ref{eq:Re_tot} allows us to 
identify the relationships among device-level rebound ($Re_{dev}$) and
embodied, substitution, and income and respending effects.
Equation~\ref{eq:Re_tot} shows that 
embodied energy rebound ($Re_{emb}$) contributes additively to total rebound
and is unaffected by device-level rebound.
When the embodied energy rate for an energy-service-providing device 
goes up (down) due to $U$, 
total rebound also increases (decreases)
by the same amount.
Equation~\ref{eq:Re_emb} shows that 
increasing embodied energy ($\after{E}_{\femb} > \before{E}_{\femb}$)
and 
shorter device lifetimes ($\after{t} < \before{t}$)
both increase embodied energy rebound.

When costs for procuring, operating, maintaining, and disposing
the energy efficient device 
(as represented by $\gamma$)
go up (down),
total rebound decreases (increases), because
device costs reduce (increase) net freed cash available 
for spending in the economy.

While the effects of embodied energy and device costs on total rebound
can be ascertained by inspection of Equation~\ref{eq:Re_tot},
the effect of device-level rebound ($Re_{dev}$) is less clear, 
as $Re_{dev}$ appears in two terms with the opposite sense.
The first instance of $Re_{dev}$ (in the second term of Equation~\ref{eq:Re_tot}) 
enhances total rebound directly.
The second instance of $Re_{dev}$ (in the third term of Equation~\ref{eq:Re_tot})
reduces total rebound, 
indicating that, as observed by \Tt{}, 
income effect rebound is inversely related to device-level rebound.
The inverse relationship arises because energy cost savings taken back by device-level rebound
cannot be spent in the economy, thereby reducing rebound from the inccome effect.
Which effect dominates is shown by Equation~\ref{eq:Re_sub}:
device-level rebound 
enhances (reduces) total rebound when $I_{E_f} p_{E_f}$ is less than (greater than) 1.

**** Not sure this is right yet. ****  The effect of service price elasticity of final energy demand ($\epsilon$) 
on total rebound ($Re$) is similarly
confounded by the relationship between the product $I_{E_f} p_{E_f}$ and 1.
We assume that, typically,
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item $U$ increases final-energy-to-services efficiency ($\after{\eta} > \before{\eta}$) and
  
  \item $\epsilon < 0$ such that 
        the increase in final-energy-to-services efficiency
        leads to a reduction in service price ($\after{p}_s < \before{p}_s$)
        and additional device usage such that $Re_{dev} > 0$.
    
\end{enumerate*}
%
When $I_{E_f} p_{E_f}$ is less than (greater than) 1, 
higher service price elasticity of demand (a more-negative $\epsilon$)
will lead to larger (smaller) energy rebound, 
because $Re_{dev}$ gets more positive as $\epsilon$ gets more negative and $1 - p_{E_f} I_{E_f}$ is positive (negative). 

The third term of Equation~\ref{eq:Re_tot} shows that 
when $1 - Re_{dev}/k - \gamma > 0$, 
total energy rebound is enhanced by
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item a larger multiplier ($k$) due to enhanced respending in the economy,        
  
  \item higher energy prices ($p_{E_f}$) as greater energy cost savings from $U$ are spent in the economy, and
  
  \item higher final energy intensity of the economy ($I_{E_f}$) as respent energy cost savings demand additional energy in the economy.
    
\end{enumerate*}
%
If, on the other hand, $1 - Re_{dev}/k - \gamma < 0$, 
total energy rebound is reduced by a larger multiplier ($k$),
higher energy prices ($p_{E_f}$), and 
higher final energy intensity of the economy ($I_{E_f}$).

Total final energy rebound simplifies to $k I_{E_f} p_{E_f}$ if  
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item $U$ carries no additional embodied energy ($\after{E}_{\femb} = \before{E}_{\femb}$, leading to $Re_{emb} = 0$),
  
  \item $U$ has no device-level rebound ($\epsilon = 0$ or $\after{\eta} = \before{\eta}$, leading to $Re_{dev} = 0$), and 
  
  \item $U$ is costless ($\rateafter{C}_{dev} = \ratebefore{C}_{dev}$, leading to $\gamma = 0$).
    
\end{enumerate*}

\subsection{Model derivation}
\label{sec:model_derivation}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section shows the derivation of the symbolic rebound model.
Like \cite{Borenstein:2015aa}, we consider three contributing factors to rebound,
embodied energy effects, 
substitution effects, and
income effects.
Energy rebound for each effect~($j$) can be calculated by
$Re_j = 1 - \frac{\mathrm{actual \, energy \, savings_i}}{\mathrm{expected \, energy \, savings}}$, 
where expected energy savings are measured at the device level,
assuming no change in the rate of service, 
no substitution, 
and no change of embodied energy.
Actual energy savings are given by 
$\mathrm{actual \, energy \, savings} = \mathrm{expected \, energy \, savings} - \mathrm{takeback}$.
Thus, 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:rebound_1}
  Re_j = \frac{\mathrm{takeback}_j}{\mathrm{expected \, energy \, savings}} \, .
\end{equation}


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Preliminaries} 
\label{sec:preliminaries}
%------------------------------

Service price~($p_s$) is related to final energy price~($p_{E_f}$) through
final-energy-to-service efficiency~($\eta$) by  
$p_s = p_{E_f}/\eta$, where
$p_s$ could be in \$/vehicle-mile, 
$p_{E_f}$ in \$/MJ, and
$\eta$ in vehicle-miles/MJ
for an automobile efficiency upgrade.
As final-energy-to-service efficiency~($\eta$) increases,
service price~($p_s$) declines.
Final-energy-to-services efficiency~($\before{\eta}$) is the inverse of 
\Ba{}'s $e$,
such that $\before{\eta} = 1/e$ and $\after{\eta} = 1/\widetilde{e}$.

The rate of service provided by the device~($\rate{q}_s$) is related to 
final-energy-to-service efficiency~($\eta$) and 
the rate of direct final energy consumption by the device~($\rate{E}_{\fdir}$) by
$\rate{q}_s = \eta \rate{E}_{\fdir}$, where
$\rate{q}_s$ could be in vehicle-miles/year and
$\rate{E}_{\fdir}$ in MJ/year.
As final-energy-to-service efficiency~($\eta$) increases,
a higher rate of service~($\rate{q}_s$) can be provided for the same
rate of final energy consumption by the device~($\rate{E}_{\fdir}$).
Also, $\rate{E}_{\fdir} = \rate{q}_S / \eta$.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Expected energy savings} 
\label{sec:expected_energy_savings}
%------------------------------

Prior to the energy efficiency upgrade~($U$), 
the device has final-energy-to-services efficiency of $\before{\eta}$, and
the user of the energy conversion device consumes services 
provided by the device at a rate of $\ratebefore{q}_s$, 
which implies the final energy consumption rate of the device to be
$\ratebefore{E}_{\fdir} = \ratebefore{q}_s / \before{\eta}$.
After $U$, the rate of final energy consumption by the device is
$\rateafter{E}_{\fdir} = \ratebefore{q}_s / \after{\eta}$, 
because the rate of service consumption is assumed to be unchanged 
(i.e., $\rateafter{q}_s = \ratebefore{q}_s$).
The change in the direct energy consumption rate of the device~($\Delta \rate{E}_{\fdir}$) 
due to $U$ is given by 
$\Delta \rate{E}_{\fdir} = \frac{\ratebefore{q}_s}{\after{\eta}} - \frac{\ratebefore{q}_s}{\before{\eta}}$, 
which can be rearranged to be
%
\begin{equation}
  \Delta \rate{E}_{\fdir} = \left( \frac{\before{\eta}}{\after{\eta}} - 1 \right) \ratebefore{E}_{\fdir} \, ,
\end{equation}
%
using $\ratebefore{E}_{\fdir} = \frac{\ratebefore{q}_s}{\before{\eta}}$.
If $\after{\eta} \rightarrow \infty$, 
all final energy consumption is eliminated, and 
$\Delta \rate{E}_{\fdir} = - \ratebefore{E}_{\fdir}$, as expected.
If efficiency increases due to $U$ such that $\after{\eta} > \before{\eta}$, 
the rate of final energy consumption declines, and 
$\Delta \rate{E}_{\fdir} < 0$,
as expected.

The expected, device-level energy savings is the negative of the change in direct, final energy consumption, 
or $-\Delta \rate{E}_{\fdir} = (1 - \before{\eta} / \after{\eta}) \ratebefore{E}_{\fdir}$.
Thus Equation~\ref{eq:rebound_1} can be rewritten as
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:rebound_2}
  Re_i = \frac{\mathrm{takeback_i}}{\left(1 - \frac{\before{\eta}}{\after{\eta}} \right) \ratebefore{E}_{\fdir}} \, .
\end{equation}



%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Embodied energy effect} 
\label{sec:embodied_effect_derivation}
%------------------------------

Prior to $U$, the embodied final energy of the device is $E_{\femb}$.
After $U$, the embodied final energy of the device is $\after{E}_{\femb}$.
We allocate embodied energy over the life of the device ($\before{t}$ and $\after{t}$) 
to obtain embodied energy rates.
The change in embodied final energy due to $U$ (expressed as a rate) is given by 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:delta_embodied}
  \Delta \rate{E}_{\femb} = \left( \frac{\after{E}_{\femb}}{\before{E}_{\femb}}
  \frac{\before{t}}{\after{t}} - 1 \right) \ratebefore{E}_{\femb} \, .
\end{equation}
%
Typically, increases in energy efficiency are associated with increased device complexity
and more embodied energy such that $\after{E}_{\femb} > \before{E}_{\femb}$. 
However, if the upgraded device has longer life than the original device
($\after{t} > \before{t}$), 
$\Delta \rate{E}_{\femb}$ can be negative,
meaning that the upgraded device has a lower embodied energy rate than the original device.

$\Delta \rate{E}_{\femb}$ represents energy savings taken back due to embodied energy effects.
Thus, Equation~\ref{eq:rebound_2} can be employed to write embodied energy rebound as
%
\begin{equation} 
  Re_{emb} = \Reembequation{} \, . \tag{\ref{eq:Re_emb}}
\end{equation}
%
Embodied energy rebound ($Re_{emb}$) increases to the extent that
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item the embodied energy of the device is greater after $U$ than before
        ($\after{E}_{\femb} > \before{E}_{\femb}$) or 
        
  \item the original embodied energy rate is greater than the original direct final energy consumption rate 
        ($\ratebefore{E}_{\femb} > \ratebefore{E}_{\fdir}$).
    
\end{enumerate*}
%
On the other hand,
embodied energy rebound will be smaller to the extent that
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
	
  \item the upgraded device has longer life than the original device
        ($\after{t} > \before{t}$) or
  
  \item $U$ increases final-energy-to-services efficiency
        ($\after{\eta} > \before{\eta}$).
    
\end{enumerate*}


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Substitution effect} 
\label{sec:substitution_effect_derivation}
%------------------------------

When a device is upgraded ($U$) to higher efficiency ($\after{\eta} > \before{\eta} > 0$), 
the service price decreases ($\after{p}_s < \before{p}_s$), and 
the quantity demanded can increase ($\rateafter{q}_s > \ratebefore{q}_s$).
The service price elasticity of demand ($\epsilon$) quantifies these dynamics such that
$\rateafter{q}_s / \ratebefore{q}_s = \left( \after{p}_s/\before{p}_s \right)^\epsilon$.
$\epsilon < 0$ is expected
such that a decrease in service price ($p_s$) yields 
an increase in service consumption ($\rate{q}_s$).
Assuming that the price of final energy does not change because of $U$
(i.e., $\after{p}_{E_f} = \before{p}_{E_f}$)
and using $p_s = p_{E_f}/\eta$, 
the new quantity demanded can be expressed in terms of service price elasticity of demand as
$\rateafter{q}_s = \ratebefore{q}_s \left( \before{\eta}/\after{\eta} \right)^\epsilon$.

As quantity of service demanded increases ($\rateafter{q}_s > \ratebefore{q}_s$), 
direct energy consumption is gained 
at the device at the efficiency of the upgraded device~($\after{\eta}$),
such that
$\rate{E}_{\fgain} = \left( \rateafter{q}_s - \ratebefore{q} \right) / \after{\eta}$.
Using $\rateafter{E}_{\fdir} = \ratebefore{q}_s / \after{\eta}$ and
$\rateafter{E}_{\fdir} = \left( \before{\eta}/\after{\eta} \right) \ratebefore{E}_{\fdir}$, 
we find that
$\rate{E}_{\fgain} = \left[ \left( \before{\eta}/\after{\eta} \right)^\epsilon - 1  \right] 
                       \left( \before{\eta}/\after{\eta} \right) \ratebefore{E}_{\fdir}$.
If $\before{\eta} = \after{\eta}$, $\rate{E}_{\fgain} = 0$, as expected.
If $\epsilon = 0$, $\rate{E}_{\fgain} = 0$, as expected.

$\rate{E}_{\fgain}$ represents energy savings taken back by the substitution effect at the device.
As such, $\rate{E}_{\fgain}$ is the source of device-level rebound ($Re_{dev}$). 
Applying Equation~\ref{eq:rebound_2} gives 
$Re_{dev} = \rate{E}_{\fgain} / \left[ \left( 1 - \before{\eta}/\after{\eta} \right) \ratebefore{E}_{\fdir} \right]$.
After simplification, the explicit expression for device-level rebound becomes
%
\begin{equation}
  Re_{dev} = \Redevequation{} \, . \tag{\ref{eq:Re_dev}}
\end{equation}

However, increased service consumption ($\rateafter{q}_s > \ratebefore{q}_s$) 
implies an increased energy cost for the device.
The increased energy cost is shifted from other non-energy expenditures in the economy
such that $\rate{C}_{\shift} = \rate{E}_{\fgain} p_{E_f}$.
Assuming that $\rate{C}_{\shift}$ reduces energy consumption 
by the energy intensity of the economy gives
$\rate{E}_{\floss} = \rate{C}_{\shift} I_{E_f} = \rate{E}_{\fgain} p_{E_f} I_{E_f}$.

The net substition effect ($\Delta \rate{E}_{\fsub}$) is given by 
$\Delta \rate{E}_{\fsub} = \rate{E}_{\fgain} - \rate{E}_{floss}$.
After substituting for $\rate{E}_{\fgain}$ and some rearranging,
the net substitution effect can be expressed as
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:delta_sub}
  \Delta \rate{E}_{\fsub} = (1 - p_{E_f} I_{E_f}) 
                            \left[ \left( \frac{\before{\eta}}{\after{\eta}} \right)^\epsilon - 1 \right]
                            \frac{\before{\eta}}{\after{\eta}} \, 
                            \rate{E}_{\fdir} \, .
\end{equation}

$\Delta \rate{E}_{\fsub}$ represents the energy savings taken back by substitution effects.
Thus, Equation~\ref{eq:rebound_2} can be employed to write substitution-effect rebound as
$Re_{sub} = (1 - p_{E_f} I_{E_f}) \left[ \left( \frac{\before{\eta}}{\after{\eta}} \right)^\epsilon  - 1 \right] 
                            / \left[ \left( \frac{\after{\eta}}{\before{\eta}} \right) - 1 \right]$. 
After simplification, substitution rebound can be expressed as
%
\begin{equation}
  Re_{sub} = \Resubequation{} \, . \tag{\ref{eq:Re_sub}}
\end{equation}


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Income and respending effects} 
\label{sec:income_effect_derivation}
%------------------------------

Energy cost savings~($\rate{G}$, in \$/year, known as ``income''\footnote{
  Energy cost savings are an ``income'' in the sense of a return on investment in energy efficiency.
  The device user's income, in the sense of remuneration for labor, is unchanged. 
}) 
are one result of the investment in $U$.
$\rate{G}$ is money that is no longer spent on energy to run the upgraded device, 
assuming the same service level from the device. 
Thus, $\rate{G} = -\Delta \rate{E}_{\fdir} p_{E_f}$. 
Because $\Delta \rate{E}_{\fdir} < 0$, $\rate{G}$ is positive.

It costs money to procure, operate, maintain, and dispose of the energy-efficient device.
But it cost money to procure, operate, maintain, and dispose of the original device, too.
If costs are spread across the life of the device, we obtain
$\rateafter{C}_{dev} = \after{C}_{pur} / \after{t} + \rateafter{C}_{OM} + \after{C}_{disp} / \after{t}$ and
$\ratebefore{C}_{dev} = \before{C}_{pur} / \before{t} + \ratebefore{C}_{OM} + \before{C}_{disp} / t$.
The change in device cost rate is given by 
$\Delta \rate{C}_{dev} = \rateafter{C}_{dev} - \ratebefore{C}_{dev}$.
After rearrangement, $\Delta \rate{C}_{dev} = \left( \rateafter{C}_{dev} / \ratebefore{C}_{dev} - 1 \right) \ratebefore{C}_{dev}.$

Freed cash ($FC$) is the difference between income and 
the change in cost rates for procuring, operating, maintaining, and disposing
the upgraded device relative to the original device.
Thus, $FC = \rate{G} - \Delta \rate{C}_{dev}$.

Assuming that the freed cash is spent in the economy at the energy intensity of the economy gives
$\Delta \rate{E}_{\finc} = FC \, I_{E_F}$.
Freed cash can be respent in the economy in a manner 
``akin to the macroeconomic multiplier that might result 
following a new discovery of a natural resource deposit'' \citep[p.~11]{Borenstein:2015aa}.
The effect of this respending can be represented by a technology multiplier~($k$).
Although \Ba{} did not include a multiplier ($k$) in his model,
we do so here.\footnote{
  To be precise, \Bt{} assumed $k = 1$.
}
Thus, the change in final energy consumption due to income and respending can be written as
$\Delta \rate{E}_{\fincres} = FC \, I_{E_f} k$.
The discussion above yields
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:delta_income}
  \Delta \rate{E}_{\fincres} = \left( 1 - \frac{\before{\eta}}{\after{\eta}} 
                                 - \frac{\rateafter{C}_{dev} - \ratebefore{C}_{dev}}{\ratebefore{E}_{\fdir} p_{E_f}} \right) 
                               k I_{E_f} p_{E_f} \ratebefore{E}_{\fdir} \, .
\end{equation}

Without the energy efficiency upgrade ($U$),
$\after{\eta} = \before{\eta}$, $\rateafter{C}_{dev} = \ratebefore{C}_{dev}$, and
$\Delta \rate{E}_{\fincres} = 0$, as expected.
As $\after{\eta}$ increases relative to $\eta$, $\Delta \rate{E}_{\fincres}$ goes up, 
because the efficiency gain yields more freed cash (from energy cost savings) to spend in the economy.
$\Delta \rate{E}_{\fincres}$ goes up when
$\rateafter{C}_{dev} < \ratebefore{C}_{dev}$, also because
more freed cash is available
to be spent in the economy
(because the device costs less to procure, operate, maintain, and dispose).

$\Delta \rate{E}_{\fincres}$ represents energy savings taken back due to the income effect.
Thus, Equation~\ref{eq:rebound_2} can be employed to obtain an expression 
for rebound due to income and respending effects:
$Re_{\incres} = \Delta \rate{E}_{\fincres} / \left[ \left(1 - \frac{\before{\eta}}{\after{\eta}} \right) \ratebefore{E}_{\fdir} \right]$.
After simplification, and using the definition
$\gamma \equiv \gammaequation{}$
to represent the nondimensional effect of device costs,
rebound from income and respending effects can be written as
%
\begin{equation}
  Re_{\incres} = \Reirequation{} \, . \tag{\ref{eq:Re_ir}}
\end{equation}
%
Note that rebound from income only ($Re_i$) is obtained from Equation~\ref{eq:Re_ir} with $k = 1$.
As $\rateafter{C}_{dev} - \ratebefore{C}_{dev}$ goes up, $\gamma$ increases, and $Re_{\incres}$ goes down,
because the cost of procuring, operating, maintaining, and disposing of the device 
reduces the net energy cost savings available to be respent in the economy.
If $U$ is costless, $\rateafter{C}_{dev} = \ratebefore{C}_{dev}$, $\gamma = 0$, and 
$Re_{\incres} = k I_{E_f} p_{E_f}$, as shown by \cite{Borenstein:2015aa}.%
\footnote{
  \Bt{} assumed that the multiplier $k = 1$. 
}


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Total rebound} 
\label{sec:total_rebound_derivation}
%------------------------------

Total rebound is given by $Re = Re_{emb} + Re_{sub} + Re_{\incres}$, or 
%
\begin{equation}
  Re = \Reembequation{} + \Resubequation{} + \Reirequation{} \, .
\end{equation}
%
After substituting and rearranging, we arrive at an expression 
for total rebound expressed in terms of
embodied energy rebound~($Re_{emb}$),
device-level rebound~($Re_{dev}$), 
the nondimensionalized change in device cost rate~($\gamma$), and
economic parameters ($k$, $I_{E_f}$, and $p_{E_f}$).
%
\begin{equation}
  Re = \Retotequation{} \tag{\ref{eq:Re_tot}}
\end{equation}


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Model verification}
\label{sec:model_verification}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

\citet[pp.~15--17]{Borenstein:2015aa} provides
example calculations for rebound caused by an increase in auto fuel economy.
The details of \Ba{}'s 
fuel economy example provide the opportunity for numerical verification of
the explicit equation for rebound developed above.
Only the expressions for income and substitution effects 
($Re_{sub}$ and $Re_{i}$) in Equations~\ref{eq:Re_sub} and~\ref{eq:Re_ir} 
can be verified, because
\Ba{} did not provide 
example calculations for embodied energy rebound ($Re_{emb}$).


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Verification of substitution effect rebound ($Re_{sub}$) expression} 
\label{sec:verification_substitution}
%------------------------------

To verify the derivation of the explicit substitution effect rebound equation,
we use numbers from \Ba{}'s 
fuel economy example to calculate $Re_{sub}$ by Equation~\ref{eq:Re_sub}.
Then, we compare our answer to 
\Ba{}'s numerical estimate for $Re_{sub}$.
Agreement will indicate that the derivation of Equation~\ref{eq:Re_sub} is correct.

The explicit equation for substitution effect rebound ($Re_{sub}$) is given by
Equation~\ref{eq:Re_sub}.
Numerical quantification for each term of Equation~\ref{eq:Re_sub}
is as follows.
The price of gasoline ($p_{E,f}$) can be calculated using \Ba{}'s numbers as
$p_{E,f} = \frac{1}{(113,996 \, \mathrm{BTU/gallon})(1 \, \mathrm{gallon}/\$3)} 
= 2.6317 \times 10^{-5} \, \$/\mathrm{BTU}$.
\Ba{}'s energy intensity of the economy is $6472 \, \mathrm{BTU/\$}$.
Device-level rebound ($Re_{dev}$) is given by Equation~\ref{eq:Re_dev}.
With the price elasticity of final energy demand as $\epsilon  = -0.2$ and
$\before{\eta}$ and $\after{\eta}$ as 25 and 50 miles/gallon, respectively, 
we obtain $Re_{dev} = 0.149$.
Using the above results in Equation~\ref{eq:Re_sub}
gives $Re_{sub} = 0.124$. 
\Ba{} callculated 0.128.
We attribute the difference to rounding errors, 
as \Ba{}'s calculation involves many steps,
whereas the explicit expression in Equation~\ref{eq:Re_sub}
is evaluated directly.
The near-match verifies the derivation of Equation~\ref{eq:Re_sub}.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Verification of income effect rebound ($Re_{i}$) expression} 
\label{sec:verification_income}
%------------------------------

To verify the derivation of the explicit income effect rebound equation,
we use numbers from \Ba{}'s 
fuel economy example to calculate $Re_{i}$ by Equation~\ref{eq:Re_ir}.
Then, we compare our answer to
\Ba{}'s numerical estimate for $Re_{i}$.%
\footnote{
  Note that $Re_{i} = Re_{\incres}$ when $k = 1$ in Equation~\ref{eq:Re_ir}.
}
Agreement will indicate that the derivation of Equation~\ref{eq:Re_ir} is correct.

The explicit equation for income effect rebound ($Re_{i}$) is given by
Equation~\ref{eq:Re_ir} with $k = 1$.
Numerical quantification for each term of Equation~\ref{eq:Re_ir}
is given in Section~\ref{sec:verification_substitution} and following.
\Bt{} indicates that the fuel economy upgrade 
from $\before{\eta}$ to $\after{\eta}$
costs \$3000,
and the automobile's expected lifetime is 12 years.
Thus, $\rateafter{C}_{dev} - \ratebefore{C}_{dev} = \frac{\$3000}{12 \, \mathrm{yrs}} = \$250/\mathrm{year}$.
The pre-upgrade direct final energy consumption rate
($\ratebefore{E}_{\fdir}$)
is calculated from expected usage (12,000 mi/yr) and the pre-upgrade efficiency ($\eta$) as
$\ratebefore{E}_{\fdir} = (12,000 \, \mathrm{mi/yr})(1 \, \mathrm{gal}/25 \, \mathrm{mi}) (113,996 \, \mathrm{BTU/gal}) 
= 5.472 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{BTU/yr}$.
Using the above numbers in Equation~\ref{eq:Re_ir} with $k = 1$, 
we obtain $Re_{i} = 0.110$, 
exactly matching the value of 0.11 reported in \citet[p.~17, Table~2]{Borenstein:2015aa}.
The match verifies the derivation of Equation~\ref{eq:Re_ir}.
