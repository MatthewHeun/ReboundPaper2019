Highlights for Heun, Semieniuk, and Brockway, 2021

* Microeconomic rebound theory is scattered across papers and lacks unification
* In response, we develop a comprehensive, partial-equilibrium rebound analysis framework
* We utilize a macroeconomic factor to link macro to micro rebound effects
* Novel graphs show rebound paths through energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces
* Two case studies yield microeconomic rebounds of 24-29% and total rebounds of 48-80%
