We assume a basket of other goods purchased in the economy,
each ($i$) with its own price ($p_{o,i}$) and rate of consumption ($\rate{q}_{o,i}$),
such that the average price of all other goods purchased in the economy
prior to the EEU~($\orig{p}_o$) is given by

\begin{equation}
  \orig{p}_o = \frac{\sum\limits_i \orig{p}_{o,i} \orig{q}_{o,i}}{\sum\limits_i \orig{q}_{o,i}} \; .
\end{equation}
%
Then, the expenditure rate of other purchases in the economy can be given as

\begin{equation}
  \rorig{C}_o = \orig{p}_o \rorig{q}_o
\end{equation}
%
before the EEU and

\begin{equation}
  \rasub{C}_o = \asub{p}_o \rasub{q}_o \; 
\end{equation}
%
after the substitution effect, for example.

We assume that any effects (emplacement, substitution, or income)
for a single device 
are not so large that they 
cause a measurable change in prices of other goods. 
Thus, 

\begin{equation}
  \orig{p}_o = \aempl{p}_o = \asub{p}_o = \ainc{p}_o = \aprod{p}_o \; .
\end{equation}

Thus, across any rebound effect, two other goods prices can be equated to obtain
(for the example of the original conditions ($\circ$) 
and the post-substitution state ($\wedge$))

\begin{equation} \label{eq:qo_Co_equality}
  \frac{\rasub{C}_o}{\rorig{C}_o} 
      = \frac{\rasub{q}_o}{\rorig{q}_o} \; .
\end{equation}

Under the exogenous price of other goods assumption, 
a ratio of other goods expenditure rates
is always equal to a ratio of other goods consumption rates.
